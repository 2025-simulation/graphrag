If you want to develop and improve\nBVTKNodes for everyone, please feel free to head over to [our current\ngithub repository](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes).\n\n## Terminology\n\n- (BVTK) node = a Blender node object in BVTK node tree\n- generated node = VTK node which has been automatically generated\n- custom node = customized version of a generated node\n- VTK node = a generated or a custom node which implements a VTK class\n- special node = all other nodes in BVTK node tree\n- socket = Blender socket in a node\n- VTK object = instance of vtkObject class\n- VTK connection = instance of vtkAlgorithmOutput class\n\n## BVTK Core\n\nThe [tkeskita/bvtknodes](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes) version\nincludes a modified core functionality for BVTK Nodes, which allows\ncustom functionality to be plugged in for custom nodes. These can be\nused by adding special functions to nodes:\n\n- **init_special()** - special function to run when node is created.\n- **draw_buttons_special()** - special node UI contents.\n- **init_vtk()** - creation and initialization of VTK object.\n- **apply_inputs()** - update input connections to VTK object.\n- **validate_and_update_values_special()** - optional node value\n  validation and update routine.\n- **apply_properties_special()** - special function to run for setting\n  properties and update VTK object for special nodes.\n- **get_vtk_output_object_special()** - special function to provide VTK\n  output object for special nodes.\n\nPlease see current custom nodes located in\n<span class=\"title-ref\">custom_nodes</span> folder in the source for\nexamples.\n\n## Writing Code\n\nPython code formatting style used in this project is\n[black](https://github.com/psf/black). All Python code should be\nformatted with command <span class=\"title-ref\">black file.py</span>\navailable e.g. via <span class=\"title-ref\">pip install black</span>,\nexcept for autogenerated code files, like:\n\n- generated_nodes/\\*.py\n- b_properties.py\n- favorites_data.py\n\nAt least some short [doc\nstrings](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) should be included,\nthey are much appreciated! If you wish to improve our doc strings\nfurther, please use [Google style Python\ndocstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).\n\n## Testing Framework\n\nBVTKNodes includes a testing framework (located in the\n<span class=\"title-ref\">test</span> directory) that should help with\nchecking new updates and finding bugs.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9debc9b42908c276f4d4f34b3154e854f89e53ac8538b0578e8eec8f0988d2af_v2"}
