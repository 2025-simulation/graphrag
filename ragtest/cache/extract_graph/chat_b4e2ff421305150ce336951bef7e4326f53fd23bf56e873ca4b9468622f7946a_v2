Simply put, the addon makes VTK classes available as\nnodes in Blender. A manually programmed node class can supercede\nautomatically generated code where needed. It is fairly easy to\nupgrade/downgrade to another VTK version, including customized VTK\nbuilds, so this makes BVTKNodes an option for prototyping and testing of\nVTK pipelines.\n\nBVTKNodes includes many custom made nodes that make it possible to\naccess VTK time step data, multi block data, and to color surfaces\naccording to a customizable color ramp. For nodes which have not yet\nbeen fully customized for use in Blender, it is possible to add Custom\nCode for VTK objects. This is often needed, since many VTK objects\nrequire custom input from user to work correctly.\n\nWhen update of the node tree is triggered, each parameter and value\nshown in the node is set to the VTK object represented by the node,\nunless the value is empty. It is not possible to affect the order in\nwhich values are set, which may result in unwanted behavior. In this\ncase, please see `custom_code`. Custom code is always run at last.\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> BVTKNodes is a [bleeding edge\n> software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bleeding_edge_technology).\n> Because both Blender and VTK are constantly evolving pieces of\n> software, it is expected that customized parts in BVTKNodes can break\n> when versions change. Many parts of the addon would benefit from\n> further development. Addon is prone to crashing, and results should\n> always be reviewed critically for bugs. There is no guarantee: you use\n> the addon at your own risk.\n\n## Available Versions of BVTKNodes addon\n\n### 1. [simboden/bvtknodes](https://github.com/simboden/BVtkNodes)\n\nOriginal version of BVTKNodes for Blender version 2.79 using VTK 8.0.1.\nThis version was demonstrated in the [Blender Conference 2018\npresentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcF4LBTTyvk).\n\n### 2. [tkeskita/bvtknodes](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes)\n\nUpgraded and developed version for Blender 4.2 or 3.6 LTS series using\nVTK 9.2.6. Uses a new update system and a new mesh generator node *VTK\nTo Blender Mesh* instead of the legacy *VTK To Blender* node.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This documentation corresponds to\n> [tkeskita/bvtknodes](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes) version.\n\n### 3.
