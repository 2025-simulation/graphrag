Color ramp values are available via [Particle Info\n  node](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/input/particle_info.html)'s\n  *lifetime* output (until a better access becomes possible).\n- **Particle Count** specifies the maximum number of particles which\n  will be converted into the Particle System.\n- **Generate Material** will generate a default colored diffuse material\n  which will be used for glyph object at particle locations.\n- **Initialize** operator will initialize the Blender Particle System\n  with the number of particles specified in *Particle Count*. This\n  operator must be run before node pipeline is updated.\n- **Update Node** updates the node pipeline connected to this node.\n\n**Usage**: First, create a glyph object. Then input the data in node\nfields, and run **Initialize**. After that, every run of Update Node\nupdates the particle data. Note:\n\n- Running Update Node after changing frame number in Blender Timeline is\n  required to update particle data correctly.\n- Particles may not show up updated in the 3D Viewport after frame\n  change, but they should be still rendered correctly. Left-clicking on\n  3D viewport should update the view.\n- Particle colors show up correctly only in Rendered Viewport Shading\n  mode, and only using Cycles Render Engine.\n- It is not possible to modify particles in Blender. You need to do all\n  modifications on VTK side prior to using this node.\n\nThe example tree *cubeflow_particle_instancing* illustrates the usage of\nthis node:\n\n- Run **Update Node** on *VTK To Blender Mesh* node.\n- Run **Initialize** on *VTK To Blender Particles* node.\n- Run **Update Node** on *VTK To Blender Particles* node.\n- Left-click on 3D viewport to force update of the view.\n- Change the Render Engine to Cycles.\n- Render Image to see results (with correct colors).\n\n### VTK To Blender Volume\n\nThis node converts 3D VTK image data (*vtkImageData*) into OpenVDB\ngrids. The VDB data is then automatically imported into Blender as a\nVolume Object, ready to be used in volumetric rendering using the\n*Principled Volume Shader*.
