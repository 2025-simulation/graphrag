Note: Some tabs become visible only after you select a\nVTK node in the node tree. The properties and operations shown in tabs\nwill affect the active node.\n\n### Item, Tool and View Tabs\n\nThese tabs are just default Blender tabs, which show node properties,\nnode tools and view.\n\n### Properties\n\n- **Show/Hide Properties** shows list of VTK object boolean properties,\n  which can be hidden or shown in the node based on this setting. Values\n  for hidden properties are ignored (not set to VTK objects during\n  updates).\n- **Edit Custom Code** operator copies node's custom code into **BVTK**\n  Text Block in Text Editor, where it is possible to add and edit Python\n  code. The code will be run, line by line, for the VTK object\n  represented by this node when the node is updated.\n- **Save Custom Code** operator saves the text from the BVTK Text Block\n  into custom code storage string of the active node. Custom Code will\n  be shown in the node (editor screen updates when mouse cursor enters\n  it) if there is any saved to it.\n\n### Inspect\n\nThis tab contains global settings, tools for debugging and information.\n\n- Inspect tab shows the add-on and VTK versions at the top.\n- **Update Mode** is a global setting which determines when changes made\n  in node properties are updated to the corresponding VTK Object and\n  output.\n  - **No Automatic Updates** will trigger no updates. Downstream nodes\n    are only informed that a change was made (status changes to\n    *Upstream changed*).\n  - **Update Current Automatically** will only update current node and\n    upstream nodes, if they are out-of-date.\n  - **Update All Automatically** will update upstream nodes (if needed),\n    the current node and downstream nodes automatically.\n\nThe following operators are available, depending on which node is\nactive:\n\n- **Update Node** operator will call a node specific update routine on\n  the active node. The update routine initializes a VTK object (if no\n  VTK Object exists), sets properties from node to the VTK Object and\n  runs VTK level update command(s). This operator is available also as a\n  button on every node, but only if the node status is not *Up-to-date*.\n- **Documentation** will show doc string of the VTK object in the BVTK\n  Text Block in the Text Editor.\n- **Node Status** will show status of the VTK object in the BVTK Text\n  Block in the Text Editor.\n- **Output Status** will show status of the VTK object in the BVTK Text\n  Block in the Text Editor.\n- **Online Documentation** will open up web browser showing the\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
