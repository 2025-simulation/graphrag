Lines starting with\n<span class=\"title-ref\">\\#</span> are ignored as comment lines. Custom\nCode is run after the settings shown on the node have been set to the\nVTK object, so it is possible to overwrite settings with Custom Code.\n\nEditing of Custom Code is done using Blender Text Editor:\n\n- Select a VTK node in BVTK Node Tree\n- In *Properties* Tab, run **Edit Custom Code**.\n- Go to Blender Text Editor, and add/edit code in **BVTK** text block.\n- To save edited text to active node, run **Save Custom Code** in\n  *Properties* Tab. Updated code is shown on the node bottom when mouse\n  cursor enters BVTK Node Tree area (see bottom example in\n  `extract_boundary_surfaces`, *vtkOpenFoamReader* node)\n\nYou can find Edit and Save buttons also directly on the node if the node\nis up-to-date: Click on the eye icon on the node bottom right part to\nsee the custom code and the operator buttons.\n\n## Customized VTK Nodes\n\nVarious VTK nodes have been customized to ease use in Blender (see\n[Customization of Node Python\nCode](#customization-of-node-python-code)):\n\n### vtkContourFilter\n\nContour values are specified in two fields: First value is input in\n**Single Value** field, and the rest in the **Additional Values** field,\nas a comma separated text string of values. The Single Value field can\nbe keyframed in Blender, to create an animation of the changing value.\n\n### vtkPlane\n\nThis node specifies an infinite plane suitable for e.g. slicing 3D VTK\ncell data (see example `cutting_field_data`). Plane can be specified by\nmanual input of **Normal** and **Origin** vectors, or by selecting an\nexisting Blender Object (must be either a Plane or an Empty Blender\nObject type) from the *Orientation Object* dropdown menu. The location\nand rotation of the named Blender Object is used to calculate Normal and\nOrigin for *vtkPlane*.\n\n## Special Nodes\n\n### VTK To Blender\n\nThis is the original main node, which converts VTK surface mesh data\ninto a Blender mesh. This node has been superceded by the *VTK To\nBlender Mesh* node in the\n[tkeskita/bvtknodes](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes) version.\n\n*VTK To Blender* creates faces directly out of VTK cell vertex lists,\nwithout any pre-processing. This works well when VTK data consists of\nsimple cells with ordered vertices as input, such as e.g. trigonal or\nquadrigonal boundary faces generated with *vtkGeometryFilter*. Direct\nconversion of 3D cells or polygons does not work correctly.\n\n- **Name\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VTK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VTK (Visualization Toolkit) is an open-source software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization, referenced in the context of custom nodes and filters used within Blender)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender is an open-source 3D creation suite used for modeling, animation, simulation, and rendering, which integrates with VTK through custom nodes like BVTK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BVTK NODE TREE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BVTK Node Tree is a system within Blender for managing VTK-based visualization nodes, allowing users to configure and customize VTK operations)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER TEXT EDITOR<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender Text Editor is a component of Blender used for editing custom code associated with BVTK nodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTKCONTOURFILTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vtkContourFilter is a customized VTK node in Blender used to specify contour values for visualization, supporting animation via keyframing)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTKPLANE<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vtkPlane is a specialized VTK node that defines an infinite plane for slicing 3D VTK cell data, configurable via manual vector input or linked Blender objects)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTK TO BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VTK To Blender is an original node that converts VTK surface mesh data into Blender mesh format, now superseded by VTK To Blender Mesh)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTK TO BLENDER MESH<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VTK To Blender Mesh is an updated node replacing VTK To Blender, part of the tkeskita/bvtknodes GitHub project, for improved mesh conversion)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TKESKITA/BVTKNODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>tkeskita/bvtknodes is a GitHub repository hosting an updated version of BVTK nodes for Blender, including the VTK To Blender Mesh node)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTKGEOMETRYFILTER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vtkGeometryFilter is a VTK filter referenced for generating boundary faces (e.g., trigonal or quadrigonal) that are compatible with direct conversion in VTK To Blender)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTKOPENFOAMREADER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vtkOpenFoamReader is a VTK node example used in boundary surface extraction, referenced in documentation for custom code display)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTK<|>BLENDER<|>VTK is integrated into Blender via custom nodes and the BVTK system to enable scientific visualization<|>7>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLENDER<|>BVTK NODE TREE<|>BVTK Node Tree is a subsystem within Blender for managing VTK visualization workflows<|>8>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTK NODE TREE<|>BLENDER TEXT EDITOR<|>Custom code for BVTK nodes is edited in the Blender Text Editor and saved back to nodes<|>9>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTKCONTOURFILTER<|>BVTK NODE TREE<|>vtkContourFilter is a customized node within the BVTK Node Tree system<|>8>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTKPLANE<|>BVTK NODE TREE<|>vtkPlane is a specialized node in the BVTK Node Tree used for slicing operations<|>8>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTK TO BLENDER<|>VTK TO BLENDER MESH<|>VTK To Blender Mesh supersedes VTK To Blender in the updated tkeskita/bvtknodes version<|>6>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTK TO BLENDER MESH<|>TKESKITA/BVTKNODES<|>VTK To Blender Mesh is part of the tkeskita/bvtknodes GitHub repository<|>9>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTKGEOMETRYFILTER<|>VTK TO BLENDER<|>vtkGeometryFilter produces boundary face data that VTK To Blender can correctly convert<|>7>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTKOPENFOAMREADER<|>BVTK NODE TREE<|>vtkOpenFoamReader is an example VTK node used within the BVTK Node Tree environment<|>6>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
