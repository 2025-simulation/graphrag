This allows animation of\n  time series data for readers that are not aware of time (e.g.\n  <span class=\"title-ref\">vtkPolyDataReader</span>, which can read point\n  and surface data from .vtk files).\n\n  The file name matching with the frame number is made as follows: A\n  file list is generated from files in the data directory, which follow\n  the same file naming convention (file name characters + integer\n  number + extension) as the current File Name. Then the list is sorted\n  by the integer number part, and the file name matching the (modulo of\n  the) frame number is selected. Data files are looped continuously when\n  frame number exceeds number of data files, to allow looping\n  animations. The integer number part can be arbitrary (not necessarily\n  a continuous sequence of numbers).\n\n### Global Time Keeper\n\nThe Global Time Keeper node is a special node that allows animation of\nvalues in BVTK Nodes using the Blender animation system using keyframes.\nThis is done by reimplementing the keyframe functionality, which is [not\navailable in custom node trees\ncurrently](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/issues/3). Keyframe\nhandling in BVTK is similar to the rest of Blender, i.e. keyframes can\nbe inserted on properties by pressing <span class=\"title-ref\">I</span>\non your keyboard when hovering over a property that is animatable.\nAlternatively, you can right-click and use\n<span class=\"title-ref\">Insert Keyframe</span>, or\n<span class=\"title-ref\">Clear Keyframes</span> to edit the keyframes.\nFor more information, please read the [official Blender documentation on\nkeyframes](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/animation/keyframes/index.html).\n\nIn order for BVTKNodes to actually update the values of the keyframed\nproperties, the Global Time Keeper node must be inserted into the node\ntree. Running **Update Node** after a frame change will update all\nkeyframed property values. The node also shows all properties in the\nnode tree that currently have keyframes along with the keyframe values.\n\n![image](images/global_time_keeper.png)\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Since this implementation is an unofficial reimplementation of the\n> animation feature, it does not support all features:\n>\n> - The keyframes are not accessible over the\n>   <span class=\"title-ref\">Dope Sheet</span> or\n>   <span class=\"title-ref\">Graph Editor</span>\n> - Interpolation mode is always set to linear for all properties\n\n## Python Interaction and Custom Filter\n\nIt is possible to interact with nodes and live VTK objects via Blender's\nPython Console. Python Console includes three help operators for\nBVTKNodes:\n\n- *Get Node* operator inserts text which returns access to active node.\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>VTKPOLYDATAREADER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>vtkPolyDataReader is a software component capable of reading point and surface data from .vtk files)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GLOBAL TIME KEEPER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Global Time Keeper is a special node in BVTK Nodes that enables animation of values using Blender's animation system via keyframes)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BVTK NODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BVTK Nodes is a custom node system for Blender that integrates VTK functionality and supports animation through reimplementation of keyframe features)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender is a 3D creation suite that provides animation systems including keyframes, Dope Sheet, and Graph Editor, which BVTK Nodes partially integrates with)  \n##  \n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub is referenced as the hosting platform for the BVtkNodes issue tracker, specifically issue #3 regarding keyframe support in custom node trees)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GLOBAL TIME KEEPER<|>BVTK NODES<|>Global Time Keeper is a node within the BVTK Nodes system that enables keyframe-based animation<|>9)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTK NODES<|>BLENDER<|>BVTK Nodes is a custom node system designed to work within Blender, extending its functionality with VTK-based operations<|>8)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>VTKPOLYDATAREADER<|>BVTK NODES<|>vtkPolyDataReader is used within the BVTK Nodes framework to read time series data for animation purposes<|>7)  \n##  \n(\"relationship\"<|>GITHUB<|>BVTK NODES<|>GitHub hosts the issue tracker for BVTK Nodes, indicating development and community support for the software<|>6)  \n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
