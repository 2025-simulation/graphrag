You can delete and add nodes for easy\naccess here.\n\n### Tree\n\nNode tree related operations.\n\n- **Export JSON** exports the current node tree as JSON file. Please\n  note that exported information includes full path names e.g. in VTK\n  data reader nodes.\n- **Import JSON** imports the current node tree as JSON file.\n- **Arrange** will try to arrange node tree for a clean view. Warning:\n  Does not work well for complex node trees.\n- **Examples** contains a selection of example node trees you can try\n  out.\n\n## VTK Nodes\n\nAll node names that start with lower case text 'vtk' using [camel case\nnaming convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) represent\nthe [VTK classes](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classes.html)\ndirectly, for example *vtkArrowSource*. All other nodes are [special\nnodes](#special-nodes) for BVTKNodes.\n\nSome VTK classes include several overlapping methods to specify values,\ne.g. *vtkConeSource* has options for Angle, Height and Radius, two of\nwhich is enough to specify (third property can be hidden in Properties\ntab to disable it). If all are specified, then the latter values take\nprecedence. You can hide unwanted properties (see *Properties* tab).\nHidden properties are ignored during updates.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Some VTK operations require use of *vtkPassArrays*,\n> *vtkAssignAttribute* or a node specific function to activate arrays to\n> operate on to get correct result, even if there is only one array in\n> input. See examples in `ug_nodes`.\n\n## Addition of Custom Code to VTK Nodes\n\nMany VTK nodes require special input from the user, depending on the\nnode, to work correctly. For any VTK node, it is possible to add a\n*Custom Code* block for special input commands. Each line of code must\nbe a command that can be run directly for the VTK object (e.g. set a\nvalue or call an object method). You can select a VTK node, and then use\n**Online Documentation** operator in *Inspect* Tab to find out about VTK\nspecific commands and values. Lines starting with\n<span class=\"title-ref\">\\#</span> are ignored as comment lines. Custom\nCode is run after the settings shown on the node have been set\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f31373c9fba3322597cb39bac5a583dabe05eb9526136708028edbdc773dccb7_v2"}
