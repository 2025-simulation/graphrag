Python Console includes three help operators for\nBVTKNodes:\n\n- *Get Node* operator inserts text which returns access to active node.\n- *Get VTK Object* inserts command which returns access to VTK object of\n  the active node.\n- *Get Node Output* inserts text which returns the Output of VTK object.\n\nAdditionally, there is a *Custom Filter* node available, which allows\nuser to write all of the Python code in a Blender Text Block, which is\nrun at node location. Both the Text block name and Function name must be\nsupplied in the node. For example, this code returns first block from\nthe input, similar to *Multi Block Leaf* node:\n\n    def custom_func(input_obj):\n      return input_obj.GetBlock(0)\n\nHere is another example of a *Custom Filter* which calls *vtkThreshold*\nwith custom parameter values:\n\n    def myThreshold(input_obj):\n      vtkobj = vtk.vtkThreshold()\n      vtkobj.SetInputData(input_obj)\n      attr_name = \"p\"  # Array name for thresholding\n      attr_type = vtk.vtkDataObject.FIELD_ASSOCIATION_CELLS\n      value1 = float(\"0.01\")  # min value\n      value2 = float(\"0.02\")  # max value\n      vtkobj.ThresholdBetween(value1, value2)\n      vtkobj.SetInputArrayToProcess(0, 0, 0, attr_type, attr_name)\n      vtkobj.Update()\n      return vtkobj.GetOutput()\n\nNote: Writing code for *Custom Filter* requires knowledge of VTK. Please\nrefer to [VTK documentation](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/) for\nclass specific information.\n\n## Scripting in Blender\n\nYou can create a Python script to create nodes, change node values, link\nthe nodes and run updates. Copy-paste the following code to a Text Block\nin Blender Scripting Workspace and Run Script to create\n<span class=\"title-ref\">image.png</span> render of a cone. You can\nenable *Python Tooltips* in Blender *Preferences* *Interface* section to\nsee variable name when hovering over a node setting in node tree.\n\n``` python\n# BVTKNodes Blender Python Scripting Example\nimport bpy\n\nnode_tree = bpy.data.node_groups.new(\"BVTKNodeTree\", type=\"BVTK_NodeTreeType\")\nnodes = bpy.data.node_groups[\"BVTKNodeTree\"].nodes\nlinks = bpy.data.node_groups[\"BVTKNodeTree\"].links\n\n# Create nodes\ncone = nodes.new(type=\"VTKConeSourceType\")\ncone.m_Height = 3.0\ncone.m_Radius = 1.5\nelevation = nodes.new(type=\"VTKElevationFilterType\")\nmapper = nodes.new(type=\"BVTK_Node_Color\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9c11af1cc8da9c95f15e9e54d34cf5ceade58446eff89f8112698e61ad05c7b2_v2"}
