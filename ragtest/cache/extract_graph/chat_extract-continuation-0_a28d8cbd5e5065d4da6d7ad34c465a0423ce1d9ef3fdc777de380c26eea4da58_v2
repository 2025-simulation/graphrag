Identify all entities.

From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n \n3.

See\n`volumetric_rendering` example.\n\n### VTKImageData Object Source\n\nThis node creates an empty 3D VTK image data (*vtkImageData*) object.\n\n- **Origin** is the origin coordinates of the image data.\n- **Dimensions** set the number of voxels in each primary axis.\n- **Spacing** specify voxel side lengths in the three axes.\n- **Multiplier** scales both all *Dimensions* and all *Spacing* values\n  while (approximately) retaining image bounding box size.\n\n### Info\n\nInfo node shows information about the VTK pipeline, and is useful for\nVTK debugging purposes. It is best to try to use this node whenever\nuncertain of what the current VTK pipeline contains. Currently it shows:\n\n- Type of VTK data.\n- Number of points and cells in VTK data. *Note:* \"cell\" in VTK\n  terminology can refer to a face or a 3D cell.\n- X, Y and Z coordinate ranges of the data.\n- Point and cell data (with names, type and value ranges) included in\n  the pipeline.\n\n### Color Mapper\n\nThis node assigns color to mesh data. You will see the colors in Blender\n3D Viewport when Shading Mode is set to either **Material Preview** or\n**Rendered**.\n\n- **input** connector is connected to an input node.\n- **lookuptable** connector must be connected to a *Color Ramp* node,\n  which specifies the colors for the value range.\n- **Generate Scalar Bar** will generate a color legend object to the\n  Blender scene. Warning: This feature is not working currently well.\n  Alternative for this is to prepare a separate color legend image in an\n  image manipulation program and composite that on top of the result\n  images.\n- **Color\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
