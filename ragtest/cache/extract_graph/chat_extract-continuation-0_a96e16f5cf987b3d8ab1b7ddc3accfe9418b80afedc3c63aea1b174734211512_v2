These\ninstructions help you set up a default workspace in Blender for BVTK\n(nodes), to make work easy.\n\n- Start a new file in Blender (File --\\> New --\\> General).\n\n- Delete default Cube object.\n\n- Duplicate the *Layout* Workspace (right-click --\\> Duplicate) and\n  rename the new workspace (double-click on the name) to **BVTK**.\n\n- Split the 3D Viewport horizontally, and then vertically to create 3\n  window areas.\n\n- Change top area from top left corner into *BVTK Node Tree*. If you\n  don't have this option available, then there is something wrong in the\n  installation.\n\n  ![image](images/editor_selection.png)\n\n- In BVTK Node Editor, click New to add a new node tree.\n\n- Change one of the smaller areas into *Text Editor*.\n\n- In Text Editor, click on New and rename Text into **BVTK**.\n\n- Save this setup as a Blender file so that you can use it as a template\n  when starting to process a new case.\n\n<figure>\n<img src=\"images/workspace.png\" alt=\"images/workspace.png\" />\n<figcaption>Example setup for BVTK workspace.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\n## Simple Example: Human Head Visualization\n\nHere are the steps to create the meshes for the example shown in\n[Introduction](#introduction). For other examples, see [Tree](#tree) tab\nbelow.\n\n- The data file *head.vti* is located in *examples_data* folder in the\n  sources. You can also [download head.vti from\n  github](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/blob/master/examples_data/head.vti).\n\n- Create node setup as shown in the image in\n  [Introduction](#introduction). You can add nodes from Add menu or by\n  shortcut key shift + A. Link nodes by dragging from a connector to\n  another connector.\n\n  > [!NOTE]\n  > Search bar at top of the Add Menu does not find the VTK Nodes in\n  > Blender 3.6. Please use the Menu Search (shortcut key F3) instead.\n\n- Set **FileName** in *vtkXMLImageDataReader* node by clicking on the\n  folder icon and select *head.vti* file.\n\n- In *vtkContourFilter* node click plus icon to add a contour value,\n  then set the value.\n\n- In *VTK\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BVTKNodes is a software add-on for Blender used for creating and managing VTK-based node workflows, particularly for scientific visualization tasks such as human head mesh generation)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender is an open-source 3D creation suite used for modeling, animation, simulation, and visualization; it supports add-ons like BVTKNodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub is a platform where the BVTKNodes source code and example data (such as head.vti) are hosted for public access)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TKESKITA<|>PERSON<|>Tkeskita is the GitHub user or developer who maintains the BVTKNodes repository and provides example data and installation instructions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>HEAD.VTI<|>EVENT<|>head.vti is a sample data file used in BVTKNodes tutorials for visualizing a human head dataset; it serves as input for VTK pipeline examples)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>BLENDER<|>BVTKNodes is an add-on that integrates into Blender and requires Blender to function<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>GITHUB<|>BVTKNodes source code and example files like head.vti are hosted on GitHub<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TKESKITA<|>GITHUB<|>Tkeskita is the GitHub user who published the BVTKNodes repository<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>HEAD.VTI<|>BVTKNODES<|>head.vti is an example data file used specifically with BVTKNodes for demonstration and testing purposes<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TKESKITA<|>BVTKNODES<|>Tkeskita is the developer or maintainer of the BVTKNodes software<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
