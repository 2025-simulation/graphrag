If\n  enabled, the following options become available:\n- **Motion Blur By** specifies name of a point vector field (3 value\n  components) which is to be used for creating pointwise motion for the\n  mesh. The naming convention is the same used in *Color Mapper* Node.\n  E.g. value \"P_velocity\" means that the point vector field name to be\n  applied is \"velocity\".\n- **Time Step for Motion Blur** specifies the time difference between\n  two frames. It is used for calculating the length scale of motion\n  blur.\n\nBlender's Motion Blur settings are located in the Render Properties\nPanel. The *Position* is set to *Start on Frame* to get correct blur for\nrendering an animation. A still example of motion blur is available in\nthe example node tree *cubeflow_vector_glyphs*. You need to enable\n*Motion Blur* in the *Blender To VTK Mesh* Node.\n\n![image](images/vtk_to_blender_mesh_node.png)\n\n### VTK To Blender Image\n\nThis node converts VTK Image Data (*vtkImageData*) into a Blender Image,\nviewable in Blender Image Editor. The node requires two options:\n\n- **Image Name** is the name shown for the picture in Blender Image\n  Editor.\n- **Field Name** specifies the VTK field name, values from which are\n  used for the image.\n\n**Tip:** You may use e.g. *vtkResampleToImage* to convert planar data\ninto VTK image data, see example node tree\n*cubeflow_cut_plane_to_image*.\n\n### VTK To Blender Particles\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> This node is experimental! There is an issue with rendering where\n> [render does not show particles and rendering\n> hangs.](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/issues/12)\n\nThis node converts VTK point data (points of *vtkPolyData*) into a\nBlender Particle System. It allows use of Blender particle object\ninstancing, which allows glyphing of point data (presentation of points\nwith a mesh object). Since object instancing uses little memory, a large\nnumber of points can be visualized efficiently.\n\n- **Name** is the name of the particle object to be created.\n- **Glyph Name** is the name of the glyph object which is to be\n  instanced at point locations. For oriented glyphs, the glyph should be\n  1 m in length, and point towards positive X axis. **Note**: Node will\n  not work correclty unless a glyph object is specified.\n- **Direction Vector Array Name** (optional): Name of a VTK vector data\n  array, with which the glyph object will be aligned at point locations.\n- **Scale Value\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_b1e6b29cfe87dea9bf2e54600d4026c3c0725ace77617f2e338f28cc76375435_v2"}
