User has now option to change **Update Mode** in the\n  Inspect Panel, which determines when changes in nodes are updated to\n  VTK objects. Most useful options include *No Automatic Updates* and\n  *Update All Automatically*.\n- Nodes have now `node_status` information, which is shown by node\n  colors.\n- Values of dynamic enumeration lists are stored in string properties,\n  so that it is possible to pre-define whole node trees without need to\n  run updates on nodes. This allows full pre-definition of node trees\n  e.g. for JSON imports.\n- several new *cubeflow* node tree examples (in `json_importexport` Tab)\n  available for `ug_nodes`.\n- Development for this release was made in [pull request\n  \\#46](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/pull/46).\n\n## Previous versions\n\n- A testing framework helps developers catch regression bugs.\n- `global_time_keeper` node allows animation of many node properties by\n  Blender's Keyframes feature.\n- Improved Custom Code editing.\n- Matplotlib color maps are available as presets in Color Ramp node.\n- Several bug fixes and small usability improvements.\n- More information in [pull requests at\n  github](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/pulls?q=is%3Apr).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_27efbf6a8d9d4f03a10db75155b18120c7dde0b68e91b7886e77f815652d9d3c_v2"}
