Disable\n  **Coordinate Results**. Finally you must specify the array names which\n  are operated on by Custom Code like:\n\n      AddVectorArrayName(\"U\")\n\n- See [the list of operators in vtkArrayCalculator\n  docs](https://vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkArrayCalculator.html#details).\n  Some examples for **Function** field:\n\n  - First *U* vector component can be extracted by expression like\n    `dot(U,iHat)` (old syntax `U.iHat` does not work any more)\n  - *U* vector magnitude can be calculated with `mag(U)`\n\n![image](images/ug_array_calculator_nodesetup.png)\n\n## Cutting Field Data\n\nUse *vtkCutter* in combination with a geometry generator (like\n*vtkPlane*) to slice your field data. Combine with *Color Mapper* and\n*Color Ramp* to color by field value.
