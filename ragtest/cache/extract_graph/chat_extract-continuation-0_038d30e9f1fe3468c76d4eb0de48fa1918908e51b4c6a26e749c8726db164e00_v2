Mesh\n  motion blur is implemented using Blender Shape Keys, based on mesh\n  point transformation by a vector point field.\n\n## Version 0.10\n\n- 2023-08-19: Resurrected VTK To Blender Volume Node. This was possible\n  since pyopenvdb is now included in Blender 3.6 by default.\n- 2023-08-18: Upgrade to Blender LTS version 3.6 (Python 3.10) and VTK\n  9.2.6. The previous Blender LTS version 3.3 (Python 3.10) still works\n  as well with VTK 9.2.6. This upgrade required no class changes.\n- 2023-06-09: Fixed a bug where negative scalar values were colored\n  incorrectly with Color Mapper node (absolute values of data was\n  shown).\n- 2023-01-21: Upgrade to Blender LTS version 3.3 (Python 3.10) and VTK\n  9.2.2. The previous Blender LTS version 2.93 (Python 3.9) still works\n  as well with VTK 9.2.2.\n\n## Version 0.9\n\n- 2022-07-28: Color Mapper Node now supports vector arrays as well as\n  scalar arrays as input. For vectors, magnitude of the vector is used\n  for the color scale.\n- 2022-06-12: Changed Custom Filter to fix it's tree import/export.\n- 2022-06-05: Fixed importing of colors for Color Ramp node.\n- 2022-05-28: Fixed Property listing bug for Blender 2.93 (properties\n  were not shown in the Properties tab).\n- 2022-05-28: Added VTK To Blender Image Node to convert vtkImageData to\n  a Blender Image.\n\n## Version 0.8 (2022-01-16)\n\n- Upgrade to Blender LTS version 2.93 and VTK 9.1.0. The previous\n  Blender LTS version 2.83 still works as well with VTK 9.1.0.\n\n## Version 0.7 (2021-09-18)\n\n- Supported Blender LTS version 2.83 and VTK 9.0.1.\n- New node update system, where VTK updates are\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output based on the given text:\n\n(\"entity\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BVTKNodes is a version of Blender that supports VTK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender is a 3D creation software)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VTK is a C++ library for 3D visualization and manipulation of data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PYTHON<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Python is a programming language used in Blender and VTK)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENVDB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenVDB is an open-source library for volumetric data processing)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>BLENDER<|>BVTKNodes is a version of Blender that supports VTK<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>VTK<|>BVTKNodes uses VTK for 3D visualization and manipulation of data<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLENDER<|>VTK<|>Blender uses VTK for 3D visualization and manipulation of data<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PYTHON<|>OPENVDB<|>Python is used to process volumetric data with OpenVDB<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>OPENVDB<|>BVTKNodes uses OpenVDB for volumetric data processing<|>6)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLENDER<|>OPENVDB<|>Blender uses OpenVDB for volumetric data processing<|>5)\n<|COMPLETE|>\n\nNote: The relationship strength scores are arbitrary and based on the complexity of the relationships between entities."}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
