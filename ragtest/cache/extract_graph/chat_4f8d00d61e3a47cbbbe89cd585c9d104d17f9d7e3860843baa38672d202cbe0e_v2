The VDB data is then automatically imported into Blender as a\nVolume Object, ready to be used in volumetric rendering using the\n*Principled Volume Shader*. This node requires\n<span class=\"title-ref\">pyopenvdb</span> in Blender, now available in\nBlender version 3.6 and later.\n\nPlease see VTK To OpenVDB Exporter below for description of field names.\n\n### VTK To OpenVDB Exporter\n\nThis node exports selected 3D *vtkImageData* arrays (density, color,\nflame and temperature inputs) into a JSON file, which can be then\nconverted into OpenVDB (.vdb) file format using an external installation\nof *pyopenvdb*. OpenVDB files can be then imported back to Blender as a\nVolume Object for volumetric rendering, using e.g. the *Principled\nVolume Shader*.\n\n- **Name** is the base name of the OpenVDB file to be created.\n- **Density Field Name** specifies the field name of scalar array to be\n  used for the *Density* output of Volume Info node in Blender Shader\n  Editor.\n- **Color Field Name** is used for 3D vector array as *Color* output in\n  Volume Info node.\n- **Flame Field Name** is scalar field exposed as *Flame* output in\n  Volume Info node. It can be used for specifying e.g. emission\n  strength.\n- **Temperature Field Name** is a scalar field shown as *Temperature*\n  output in Volume Info node.\n\nUpon running **Update Node**, the node creates a file like\n`volume_00001.json` (format is name + frame number) into the folder\nwhere the blender file is saved. If node input is not a data suitable\nfor exporting (VTK 3D Image Data or Structured Points Data), the node\nshows an error message, otherwise data dimensions are shown.\n\nTo convert JSON file to OpenVDB, the user must run a Python script\n`convert_to_vdb.py` located in the add-on source directory *utils*.
