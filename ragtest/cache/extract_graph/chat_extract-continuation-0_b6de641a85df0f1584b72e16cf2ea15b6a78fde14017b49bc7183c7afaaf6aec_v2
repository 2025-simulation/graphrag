Examples below\nutilize the *cubeflow* OpenFOAM dataset located in *examples_data*\nfolder of the add-on sources. This is a very small and simple 5x5x5\nhexahedral mesh with 5 time points for testing and debugging purposes.\n\nThe node tree examples below are available in *Tree* tab, *Examples*,\nnames starting with *cubeflow*. After importing an example, change the\nframe number to 5 in Blender Timeline Editor, if you want to get same\nresults as in examples below. Then run *Update Node* on the final nodes\nto update the pipelines.\n\nFor more elaborate visualizations, please have a look at [a gallery\nthread on\nblenderartists](https://blenderartists.org/t/bvtknodes-gallery/1161079).\n\n![image](images/ug_cubeflow_geometry.png)\n\n## Set Up Reader\n\nThis node tree example name is *cubeflow_base_boundary*. This is a\ntypical start node setup which contains a reader node\n*vtkOpenFOAMReader* to read data, a *Time Selector* node to specify\ntime, a *Multi Block Leaf* node to select the correct data block, an\n*Info* node to show the pipeline contents, and finally a *VTK To Blender\nMesh* node to create the boundary mesh as a Blender mesh object.\n\nPress *Update Node* button on *Info* node to update pipeline. If data is\nread in correctly, the *Info* node shows number of points/cells, and\nfields read in.\n\n![image](images/ug_reader_nodesetup.png)\n\nYou need to select correct reader node depending on your data type. Note\nthat you may need to adjust reader settings and/or add *Custom Code*\n(see `custom_code`) to some readers, depending on your case and data.\nFor example, to force the parallel OpenFOAM reader *vtkPOpenFOAMReader*\nto read the decomposed case files instead of reconstructed serial case\nfiles, you must add custom code `SetCaseType(0)` to the reader node.\n\n- *vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader* for **.vtu** files\n- *vtkPolyDataReader* for some **.vtk** files\n\nThe following node setups assume that the input of the first node is\nconnected to some data source which produces *vtkUnstructuredGrid* with\ndata for 3D cells, such as the output of *Multi Block Leaf* node in\nexample above.\n\n## Extract Boundary Surfaces\n\n*VTK To Blender Mesh* node extracts all boundary surfaces.\n\n![image](images/vtk_to_blender_mesh_node.png)\n\nFor forks other than\n[tkeskita/bvtk\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CUBEFLOW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Cubeflow refers to an OpenFOAM dataset used for testing and debugging in unstructured grid processing, contained within the examples_data folder of an add-on; it is not a formal organization but treated here as a named dataset entity per context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender is an open-source 3D creation suite referenced through its Timeline Editor and node-based pipeline system for visualizing scientific data)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDERARTISTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blenderartists is an online community forum where users share galleries and examples, including those related to BVTKNodes)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BVTKNodes is an add-on or software tool used within Blender for processing VTK (Visualization Toolkit) data, particularly unstructured grids like those from OpenFOAM)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OPENFOAM<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenFOAM is an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software suite that generates simulation data, such as the cubeflow dataset, used in scientific visualization workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TKESKITA/BVTK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Tkeskita/bvtk appears to reference a GitHub repository or software fork related to BVTKNodes, though the name is cut off in the text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUBEFLOW_BASE_BOUNDARY<|>EVENT<|>Cubeflow_base_boundary is the name of a specific node tree example used to set up a data reading pipeline for OpenFOAM data in BVTKNodes)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUBEFLOW<|>OPENFOAM<|>The cubeflow dataset is an OpenFOAM simulation case used for testing<|>9>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>BLENDER<|>BVTKNodes is an add-on that operates within Blender to visualize VTK data<|>9>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BLENDERARTISTS<|>BVTKNODES<|>Blenderartists hosts a gallery thread showcasing BVTKNodes visualizations<|>7>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUBEFLOW_BASE_BOUNDARY<|>CUBEFLOW<|>The cubeflow_base_boundary node setup is designed to read and process the cubeflow OpenFOAM dataset<|>8>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TKESKITA/BVTK<|>BVTKNODES<|>Tkeskita/bvtk is a fork or variant of the BVTKNodes software<|>6>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
