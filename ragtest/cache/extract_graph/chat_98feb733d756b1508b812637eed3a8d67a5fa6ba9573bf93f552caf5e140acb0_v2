[esowc/sci_vis](https://github.com/esowc/sci_vis)\n\nA version with new features for Blender 2.79b using VTK 8.2.0. Old\nBlender version is used for stability and [animation features that are\nnot yet working correctly in Blender 2.80 or\nnewer](https://developer.blender.org/T66392).\n\n## Installation of VTK for Blender\n\nBVTKNodes requires VTK to be available as a module in Blender's Python\nenvironment. It is suggested to [install VTK into Blender Python via\nPip](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/blob/master/pip_install_vtk.md).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> **Optional, for experts:** Another VTK version (7 or later) may be\n> alternatively used, but this requires compilation of VTK. Details are\n> beyond this document, but to summarize briefly: If another version is\n> used, then generated class definitions (gen_VTK\\*.py files) should\n> also be updated (by running populate_db.py and generate.py. Warning:\n> Modifications may be required). If you want to compile custom VTK,\n> please see [VTK building instructions for\n> Linux](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/blob/master/build_vtk.md).\n\n## Installation\n\n- Install Blender (if needed, see\n  [instructions](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/getting_started/installing/index.html)).\n- Install VTK to Blender Python as instructed above in [Installation of\n  VTK for Blender](#installation-of-vtk-for-blender).\n- Download appropriate BVTKNodes add-on ZIP file (see options in\n  [Available Versions of BVTKNodes\n  addon](#available-versions-of-bvtknodes-addon)). To download add-on\n  from Github, Select “Code”, then “Download ZIP”.\n- Start Blender, go to “Edit” –\\> “Preferences” –\\> “Add-ons” –\\>\n  “Install” –\\> open the add-on zip file.\n- Activate the “BVTKNodes” add-on in Preferences by clicking on the\n  checkbox. Add-on is located in Node category, \"Community\" level of\n  Blender add-ons.\n- **For Blender 2.79:** User Settings are located in File menu, and it\n  is suggested to **Save User Settings** before closing settings.\n\n## Removal and Upgrading\n\nBefore installation of an updated version of BVTKNodes add-on, you\nshould first remove the old version:\n\n- Go to “Edit” –\\> “Preferences” –\\> “Add-ons” –\\> \"BVTKNodes\" -\\>\n  Remove\n- Close Blender and open again.
