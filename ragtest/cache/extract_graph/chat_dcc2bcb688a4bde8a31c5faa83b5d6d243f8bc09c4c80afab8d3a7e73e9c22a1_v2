Examples below\nutilize the *cubeflow* OpenFOAM dataset located in *examples_data*\nfolder of the add-on sources. This is a very small and simple 5x5x5\nhexahedral mesh with 5 time points for testing and debugging purposes.\n\nThe node tree examples below are available in *Tree* tab, *Examples*,\nnames starting with *cubeflow*. After importing an example, change the\nframe number to 5 in Blender Timeline Editor, if you want to get same\nresults as in examples below. Then run *Update Node* on the final nodes\nto update the pipelines.\n\nFor more elaborate visualizations, please have a look at [a gallery\nthread on\nblenderartists](https://blenderartists.org/t/bvtknodes-gallery/1161079).\n\n![image](images/ug_cubeflow_geometry.png)\n\n## Set Up Reader\n\nThis node tree example name is *cubeflow_base_boundary*. This is a\ntypical start node setup which contains a reader node\n*vtkOpenFOAMReader* to read data, a *Time Selector* node to specify\ntime, a *Multi Block Leaf* node to select the correct data block, an\n*Info* node to show the pipeline contents, and finally a *VTK To Blender\nMesh* node to create the boundary mesh as a Blender mesh object.\n\nPress *Update Node* button on *Info* node to update pipeline. If data is\nread in correctly, the *Info* node shows number of points/cells, and\nfields read in.\n\n![image](images/ug_reader_nodesetup.png)\n\nYou need to select correct reader node depending on your data type. Note\nthat you may need to adjust reader settings and/or add *Custom Code*\n(see `custom_code`) to some readers, depending on your case and data.\nFor example, to force the parallel OpenFOAM reader *vtkPOpenFOAMReader*\nto read the decomposed case files instead of reconstructed serial case\nfiles, you must add custom code `SetCaseType(0)` to the reader node.\n\n- *vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader* for **.vtu** files\n- *vtkPolyDataReader* for some **.vtk** files\n\nThe following node setups assume that the input of the first node is\nconnected to some data source which produces *vtkUnstructuredGrid* with\ndata for 3D cells, such as the output of *Multi Block Leaf* node in\nexample above.\n\n## Extract Boundary Surfaces\n\n*VTK To Blender Mesh* node extracts all boundary surfaces.\n\n![image](images/vtk_to_blender_mesh_node.png)\n\nFor forks other than\n[tkeskita/bvtk\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_dcc2bcb688a4bde8a31c5faa83b5d6d243f8bc09c4c80afab8d3a7e73e9c22a1_v2"}
