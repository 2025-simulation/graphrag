This addon makes it\npossible to create and execute VTK pipelines configured in Blender Node\nEditor, to produce objects like surface meshes, which can be then\nmodified and visualized in Blender.\n\nBVTKNodes provides Blender users with access to data readers for many\nscientific data formats, along with capability to convert VTK data into\nBlender objects. For VTK users, the add-on provides access to high\nquality photorealistic rendering and many kinds of mesh editing tools.\nThe add-on was first presented at [Blender Conference\n2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcF4LBTTyvk). You can see more\nexamples in [a gallery thread on\nblenderartists](https://blenderartists.org/t/bvtknodes-gallery/1161079).\n\n![image](images/isosurfaces.png)\n\n## Target Use and Users\n\nBVTKNodes integrates VTK's data processing capabilities with Blender's\npowerful visualization features. It allows creation of\n**photorealistic** images and animations from scientific data.\n\nUse of BVTKNodes requires both Blender and VTK skills. User needs to\nknow at least Blender 3D Viewport, Node Editor, Materials, Lighting and\nRendering basics, as well as VTK (to the extent required by users'\nspecific case). If photorealistic rendering or specialized VTK pipelines\nare not required, then it is suggested to use\n[Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/) instead.\n\nTo learn Blender, see resources at\n[blender.org](https://www.blender.org/) , [Blender 2.8 fundamentals\nseries in\nYoutube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLa1F2ddGya_-UvuAqHAksYnB0qL9yWDO6)\nand search for Blender tutorials on a topic. To learn VTK, see [VTK\nwiki](https://vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Learning_VTK), [the VTK\nTextbook](https://vtk.org/vtk-textbook/) and view [VTK discourse\nforum](https://discourse.vtk.org/). For BVTKNodes, see `help`.\n\n## Technical Details and Limitations\n\nBVTKNodes is based on automatic generation of Blender Node classes from\nVTK Python classes. Simply put, the addon makes VTK classes available as\nnodes in Blender. A manually programmed node class can supercede\nautomatically generated code where needed. It is fairly easy to\nupgrade/downgrade to another VTK\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Here is the output for the given text and entity types:\n\n**Entities**\n\n(\"entity\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BVTKNodes is an addon for Blender that makes it possible to create and execute VTK pipelines configured in Blender Node Editor)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>The Visualization Toolkit (VTK) is an open source library for scientific data processing and visualization)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender is an open source 3D content creation and visualization tool)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PARAVIEW<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Paraview is a software application that provides a comprehensive environment for processing, visualizing, and analyzing large-scale scientific data)\n\n**Relationships**\n\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>VTK<|>BVTKNodes makes it possible to create and execute VTK pipelines configured in Blender Node Editor<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>BLENDER<|>BVTKNodes integrates VTK's data processing capabilities with Blender's powerful visualization features<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>VTK<|>PARAVIEW<|>VTK and Paraview are both software applications that provide comprehensive environments for processing, visualizing, and analyzing large-scale scientific data<|>5)\n\n**COMPLETE**\n\nNote: The relationship strength scores are arbitrary and based on the complexity of the relationships between entities."}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
