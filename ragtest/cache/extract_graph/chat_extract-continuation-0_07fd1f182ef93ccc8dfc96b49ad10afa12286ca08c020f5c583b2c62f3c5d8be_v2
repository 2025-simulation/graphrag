User has now option to change **Update Mode** in the\n  Inspect Panel, which determines when changes in nodes are updated to\n  VTK objects. Most useful options include *No Automatic Updates* and\n  *Update All Automatically*.\n- Nodes have now `node_status` information, which is shown by node\n  colors.\n- Values of dynamic enumeration lists are stored in string properties,\n  so that it is possible to pre-define whole node trees without need to\n  run updates on nodes. This allows full pre-definition of node trees\n  e.g. for JSON imports.\n- several new *cubeflow* node tree examples (in `json_importexport` Tab)\n  available for `ug_nodes`.\n- Development for this release was made in [pull request\n  \\#46](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/pull/46).\n\n## Previous versions\n\n- A testing framework helps developers catch regression bugs.\n- `global_time_keeper` node allows animation of many node properties by\n  Blender's Keyframes feature.\n- Improved Custom Code editing.\n- Matplotlib color maps are available as presets in Color Ramp node.\n- Several bug fixes and small usability improvements.\n- More information in [pull requests at\n  github](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/pulls?q=is%3Apr).\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>BLENDER LTS<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Blender LTS is a long-term support version of the Blender 3D creation suite, specifically version 2.83 referenced in this context)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>VTK<|>ORGANIZATION<|>VTK (Visualization Toolkit) is an open-source software system for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and visualization, referenced here as version 9.0.1)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>TKESKITA<|>PERSON<|>Tkeskita is the GitHub username of the developer or maintainer associated with the BVtkNodes repository and pull request #46)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>ORGANIZATION<|>BVtkNodes is a software project or repository on GitHub that integrates VTK with Blender through node-based workflows)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>GITHUB<|>ORGANIZATION<|>GitHub is the software development platform hosting the BVtkNodes repository and its associated pull requests)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>PULL REQUEST #46<|>EVENT<|>Pull request #46 is a specific code contribution merged into the BVtkNodes repository on GitHub, associated with the development of version 0.7 released on 2021-09-18)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>BLENDER LTS<|>BVtkNodes supports integration with Blender LTS version 2.83 for node-based VTK workflows<|>7>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>VTK<|>BVtkNodes interfaces with VTK 9.0.1 to enable visualization and data processing within Blender<|>8>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TKESKITA<|>BVTKNODES<|>Tkeskita is the developer or maintainer of the BVtkNodes GitHub repository<|>9>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>BVTKNODES<|>GITHUB<|>BVtkNodes is hosted on GitHub, where its development and pull requests are managed<|>8>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>PULL REQUEST #46<|>BVTKNODES<|>Pull request #46 was a key development contribution to the BVtkNodes project for version 0.7<|>7>\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>TKESKITA<|>PULL REQUEST #46<|>Tkeskita authored or managed pull request #46 in the BVtkNodes repository<|>8>\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
