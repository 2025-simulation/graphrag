This requires that\n  the root folder name of BVTKNodes is named exactly as\n  <span class=\"title-ref\">BVtkNodes</span>. If you've installed\n  BVTKNodes by downloading zip file from Github, the folder name is most\n  likely <span class=\"title-ref\">BVtkNodes-master</span> (you can see\n  the full path in Blender Preferences -\\> Add-ons list), and the tests\n  fail. In this case you can disable BVTKNodes add-on in Blender, rename\n  the folder, and re-enable the add-on.\n- Set environment variable *BLENDER_PATH* to the Blender executable that\n  you want to test.\n- Run `python test/test_main.py` with a Python environment that has\n  NumPy (and optionally PyVista, best installed using pip) package\n  installed.\n\nRunning the tests should result in an \"OK\" output similar to the\nfollowing:\n\n``` bash\n........\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nRan 8 tests in 36.380s\n\nOK\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Tests can be also run from Blender's Python environment (see\n> `vtk_installation`).\n\n### Writing Tests\n\nBVTKNodes is currently not extensively tested and would benefit from\nadditional tests. Nonetheless, we hope that new features would include\nat least one test to check that the features are working as expected.\n\nTypical test applies <span class=\"title-ref\">test_template.blend</span>\nfile which includes an empty node tree, and a JSON file that defines the\nnode tree. Optionally an additional Python script can be provided to run\nspecial commands. If no additional script is provided, a general\n<span class=\"title-ref\">test_blender_script.py</span> is called. This\nscript executes the tree once (using the <span class=\"title-ref\">Update\nAll</span> node, which must be present in the node tree) and checks for\nany errors. For discussion about testing, please check\n[\\#57](https://github.com/tkeskita/BVtkNodes/pull/57). See\n`Tree <json_importexport>` on how to create the JSON file from an\nexisting node tree.\n\n`BVTKMainExamples` in <span class=\"title-ref\">test_main.py</span>\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_365b29edeaca819ef4eeaab484304eb67066d4c8d2a4ba2354efaf6af2840d6f_v2"}
