Mesh\n  motion blur is implemented using Blender Shape Keys, based on mesh\n  point transformation by a vector point field.\n\n## Version 0.10\n\n- 2023-08-19: Resurrected VTK To Blender Volume Node. This was possible\n  since pyopenvdb is now included in Blender 3.6 by default.\n- 2023-08-18: Upgrade to Blender LTS version 3.6 (Python 3.10) and VTK\n  9.2.6. The previous Blender LTS version 3.3 (Python 3.10) still works\n  as well with VTK 9.2.6. This upgrade required no class changes.\n- 2023-06-09: Fixed a bug where negative scalar values were colored\n  incorrectly with Color Mapper node (absolute values of data was\n  shown).\n- 2023-01-21: Upgrade to Blender LTS version 3.3 (Python 3.10) and VTK\n  9.2.2. The previous Blender LTS version 2.93 (Python 3.9) still works\n  as well with VTK 9.2.2.\n\n## Version 0.9\n\n- 2022-07-28: Color Mapper Node now supports vector arrays as well as\n  scalar arrays as input. For vectors, magnitude of the vector is used\n  for the color scale.\n- 2022-06-12: Changed Custom Filter to fix it's tree import/export.\n- 2022-06-05: Fixed importing of colors for Color Ramp node.\n- 2022-05-28: Fixed Property listing bug for Blender 2.93 (properties\n  were not shown in the Properties tab).\n- 2022-05-28: Added VTK To Blender Image Node to convert vtkImageData to\n  a Blender Image.\n\n## Version 0.8 (2022-01-16)\n\n- Upgrade to Blender LTS version 2.93 and VTK 9.1.0.
