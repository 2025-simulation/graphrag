ESOWC is recognized as the organization behind the sci_vis repository, a project that contributes to scientific visualization tools. Specifically, the sci_vis repository is a fork of BVTKNodes, a set of tools used for visualization within scientific computing environments. This repository is hosted or maintained by ECMWF’s Software Development group or a closely related scientific organization within ECMWF. Through initiatives like ESOWC, ECMWF fosters collaboration, innovation, and the development of software infrastructure that enhances the visualization and analysis of weather and climate data. The program appears to engage with the broader scientific and open-source communities to advance tools that support medium-range weather forecasting and related research.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482528, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 182, "prompt_tokens": 197, "total_tokens": 379, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
