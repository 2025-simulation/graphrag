Originally developed by DreamWorks Animation, OpenVDB has become a widely adopted tool in the fields of visual effects, 3D graphics, and scientific visualization. Its core strength lies in its ability to handle large, complex volumetric datasets—such as those representing smoke, fire, clouds, or other fluid simulations—with high performance and minimal memory overhead by leveraging sparse data structures. The library provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating, processing, and rendering volumetric data, making it particularly valuable in production environments where efficiency and scalability are critical. Due to its open-source nature, OpenVDB has been integrated into numerous industry-standard software applications and continues to serve as a foundational technology for both commercial and research-oriented projects involving 3D volumetric data.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484235, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 181, "prompt_tokens": 242, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
