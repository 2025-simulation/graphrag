It functions as a secondary lookup table specifically associated with \"Color Mapper.001.\" This node is likely employed to map scalar or categorical data values to a distinct color gradient, enabling differentiated visual representation within the same visualization workflow. Its presence suggests that the pipeline processes multiple data channels or visualization branches, with \"COLOR RAMP.001\" handling color mapping for a specific subset of data separate from the primary Color Ramp node.
