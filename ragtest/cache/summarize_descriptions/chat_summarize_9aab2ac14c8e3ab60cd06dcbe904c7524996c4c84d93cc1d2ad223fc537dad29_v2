Identified by the `bl_idname` `BVTK_Node_TimeSelectorType`, it functions as a filtering node designed to select specific time steps from time-varying simulation data. This node typically receives input from a `vtkOpenFOAMReader`, which provides time-series simulation output, and passes the selected time step(s) downstream—often to a Custom Filter or other processing modules.\n\nThe TIME SELECTOR supports configuration through a `time_index` parameter, which allows users to specify which time step to extract from the input dataset. Examples in the data indicate that this parameter can be set to specific integer values, such as 1 or 5, depending on the desired time step. In addition to `time_index`, the node may include other parameters like `custom_code`, offering extended control over its behavior within the pipeline.\n\nAs a core component in simulation post-processing workflows, the TIME SELECTOR enables users to isolate particular moments in time from dynamic datasets, facilitating focused analysis or visualization of simulation results at those instants. Its role is consistent across descriptions: it does not modify the data itself but acts as a temporal filter, extracting subsets of time-varying data based on user-defined criteria. The node is explicitly designed for compatibility with VTK data structures and is commonly employed in scientific visualization pipelines that handle computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or other time-dependent simulations, especially those originating from OpenFOAM.\n\nAll descriptions align in portraying the TIME SELECTOR as a specialized, configurable node for time-step selection, with no substantive contradictions—only variations in phrasing and contextual detail. Its integration into VTK/Blender pipelines underscores its utility in bridging simulation data with interactive or automated visualization workflows.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484151, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 374, "prompt_tokens": 645, "total_tokens": 1019, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
