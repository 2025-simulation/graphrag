This module contains auto-generated class definitions for a diverse set of VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filters, encompassing statistical, image processing, and general-purpose filtering functionalities. Among the specific filter classes defined in this file are vtkAnnotationLink, vtkAutoCorrelativeStatistics, vtkBandedPolyDataContourFilter, and vtkBivariateLinearTableThreshold, highlighting its role in supporting both statistical analysis and geometric data processing. The file is treated as a key geographical-like entity within the project’s codebase structure, representing a critical node in the software’s architecture where VTK filter types are consolidated and auto-generated. It resides in the GENERATED_NODES directory, indicating that its contents are not hand-coded but rather produced through an automated generation process, likely as part of a build or code synthesis pipeline. This module thus functions as a unified source for multiple categories of VTK filters—including statistical filters (e.g., those performing correlation or thresholding on tabular data) and image processing filters—ensuring consistency and maintainability across the system’s visualization and data analysis capabilities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482552, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 252, "prompt_tokens": 380, "total_tokens": 632, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
