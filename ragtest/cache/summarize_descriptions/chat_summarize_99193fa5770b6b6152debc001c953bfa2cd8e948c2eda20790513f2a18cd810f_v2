Within the BVTKNodes framework, which offers a suite of nodes for integration with Blender and VTK (Visualization Toolkit) workflows, the Custom Filter serves as a user-defined processing unit that can be tailored to perform specialized data manipulation or visualization tasks. Its configurability allows users to adjust parameters or logic according to their specific simulation or rendering needs, making it a flexible tool for extending the functionality of the BVTKNodes environment. As part of the BVTKNodes ecosystem, the Custom Filter adheres to the system’s architecture for connecting and processing VTK-based data pipelines inside Blender, enabling seamless interaction between 3D modeling and scientific visualization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482729, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 174, "total_tokens": 319, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
