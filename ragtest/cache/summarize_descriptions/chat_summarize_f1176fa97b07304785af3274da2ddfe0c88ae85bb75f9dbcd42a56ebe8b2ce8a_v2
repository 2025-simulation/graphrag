It is implemented in the file generated_nodes/gen_VTKSources.py and identified by the bl_idname VTKPlaneSourceType. The node creates a flat, rectangular plane defined by several key geometric properties: a center point that specifies the plane’s origin in 3D space, a normal vector that determines its orientation, and resolution parameters—specifically m_XResolution and m_YResolution—that control the tessellation density along the plane’s local X and Y axes. This results in a structured grid of vertices and faces suitable for use as input in downstream VTK operations.\n\nOne of its primary applications is providing seed points or surfaces for streamline generation, particularly as an input to vtkStreamTracer. In this context, the planar surface produced by VTKPlaneSource acts as the starting location from which streamlines are traced through vector fields, enabling the visualization of flow patterns in scientific and engineering simulations. The planar geometry is well-suited for this role due to its uniform and controllable distribution of points across a defined area.\n\nAs a VTK source object, VTKPlaneSource exclusively produces polygonal data (vtkPolyData), consisting of vertices, lines, and polygons that represent the plane. Its parameters allow users to customize the size, orientation, and fineness of the mesh, making it a flexible tool for a variety of visualization tasks beyond streamline seeding—such as serving as a reference plane, a clipping surface, or a base geometry for further processing. Despite the varied descriptions emphasizing different aspects—geometric definition, role as a seed input, implementation details, or data type—they are complementary and collectively describe a consistent and coherent functionality.
