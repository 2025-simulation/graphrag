Although its module is not explicitly enumerated in all documentation or listings, its naming convention and structural implementation strongly imply that it is part of the auto-generated reader modules. Specifically, vtkMotionFXCFGReader is formally defined in the file generated_nodes/gen_VTKReaders.py. This placement aligns it with other similarly generated VTK reader classes, reinforcing its role as a programmatically created component designed to parse and interface with MotionFX configuration files within a VTK-based visualization or data processing pipeline. The consistent naming—using “VTK” as a prefix followed by the specific format name and “Reader” as a suffix—further confirms its integration into the standardized framework for VTK data readers. Its inclusion in generated_nodes/gen_VTKReaders.py indicates that it is likely produced by a code generation script that automates the creation of reader classes based on predefined templates or specifications, ensuring uniformity and maintainability across the suite of supported file formats.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482804, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 221, "prompt_tokens": 225, "total_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
