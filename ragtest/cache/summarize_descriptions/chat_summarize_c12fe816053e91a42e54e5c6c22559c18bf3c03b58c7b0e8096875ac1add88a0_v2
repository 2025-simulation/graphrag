It operates entirely within Blender, extending the software’s native capabilities by introducing VTK-based data processing nodes that enable users to manipulate, visualize, and analyze scientific and engineering data directly in Blender’s familiar node environment. As a plugin, BVTKNodes is not a standalone application; it requires Blender to function and is built to seamlessly integrate into Blender’s architecture. The add-on is compatible with multiple Long-Term Support (LTS) versions of Blender, ensuring stability and accessibility for users across different releases of the 3D creation suite. By leveraging the powerful data processing and visualization features of VTK—a widely used open-source library for 3D computer graphics, image processing, and scientific visualization—BVTKNodes empowers Blender users to work with complex datasets, such as volumetric data, meshes, and simulation outputs, using an intuitive, visual programming interface. This integration allows for advanced scientific visualization tasks to be performed alongside Blender’s robust modeling, animation, and rendering tools, making it a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and technical artists who rely on both scientific data and high-quality 3D visualization.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484363, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 247, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 485, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
