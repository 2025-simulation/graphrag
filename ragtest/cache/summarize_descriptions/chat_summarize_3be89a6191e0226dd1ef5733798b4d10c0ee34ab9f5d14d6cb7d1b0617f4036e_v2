Identified in Blender by the bl_idname 'VTKArrayCalculatorType', this node functions as a computational component that enables users to define custom mathematical expressions to derive new scalar or vector array values from existing ones. It operates within a node-based workflow, commonly found in visual programming environments such as Blender when integrated with VTK, allowing users to manipulate mesh or volumetric data without writing code. The core functionality of VTKArrayCalculatorType revolves around evaluating user-specified functions—such as arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, or combinations thereof—on input arrays, which can represent physical quantities like velocity, pressure, or temperature. These calculations can be applied to either point data (attributes associated with vertices) or cell data (attributes associated with mesh elements like faces or volumes), depending on the user’s configuration. By transforming or combining existing arrays, VTKArrayCalculatorType facilitates advanced data processing, feature extraction, and the generation of derived visualizations directly within the VTK pipeline. Its integration into node-based systems enhances accessibility for non-programmers while maintaining the computational power and flexibility of VTK’s underlying infrastructure. Overall, VTKArrayCalculatorType serves as a critical tool for scientific visualization workflows where on-the-fly data manipulation and mathematical transformation of field data are required.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482443, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 295, "prompt_tokens": 241, "total_tokens": 536, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
