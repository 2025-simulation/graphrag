This node enables users to selectively retain either the portion of the geometry that lies inside or outside the defined clipping region, offering control over which part of the dataset is preserved in the output. Additionally, vtkClipPolyData provides options for generating scalar values that indicate the clipping status of each point or cell, which can be useful for further processing or visualization tasks. By combining geometric clipping capabilities with flexible output controls and scalar generation, vtkClipPolyData serves as a versatile tool for manipulating and refining polygonal datasets in VTK-based visualization pipelines.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484192, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 140, "prompt_tokens": 201, "total_tokens": 341, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
