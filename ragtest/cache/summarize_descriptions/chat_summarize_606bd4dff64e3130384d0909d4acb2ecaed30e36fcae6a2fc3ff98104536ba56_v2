The project is currently hosted and actively developed in the GitHub repository under the username tkeskita, specifically at tkeskita/bvtknodes. This repository represents an upgraded and maintained version of the original BVTKNodes addon, ensuring compatibility with newer versions of Blender and VTK, as well as incorporating improvements, bug fixes, and new features contributed by the developer community. The continued development and maintenance by tkeskita signify a commitment to enhancing the functionality and usability of BVTKNodes, making it a reliable tool for scientific visualization and data processing workflows that leverage both Blender’s 3D capabilities and VTK’s powerful data handling and rendering libraries. As such, BVTKNodes—now maintained as tkeskita/BVTKNodes—serves as the go-to, up-to-date implementation of the addon for users seeking to bridge Blender and VTK in their projects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482741, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 208, "prompt_tokens": 195, "total_tokens": 403, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
