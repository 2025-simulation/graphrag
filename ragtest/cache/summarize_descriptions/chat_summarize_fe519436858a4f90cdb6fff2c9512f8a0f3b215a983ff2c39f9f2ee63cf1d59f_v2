Its primary purpose is to reduce the number of points—often to decrease glyph density or overall data density—for improved visualization performance and clarity. VTKMaskPoints operates by applying user-defined criteria to select a subset of the original points. These criteria can include specifying a maximum point count, setting a sampling ratio, or performing random selection. By doing so, it enables users to manage large point datasets more efficiently without compromising the essential structure or features of the data. As a named node within a VTK pipeline, VTKMaskPoints integrates seamlessly with other VTK components and is commonly employed in scientific visualization workflows where rendering every point would be computationally expensive or visually overwhelming. The filter is particularly useful when generating glyphs, streamlines, or other point-based visual representations where excessive point density can obscure interpretation. In summary, VTKMaskPoints serves as a versatile and essential tool for point data reduction in VTK-based applications, offering flexible subsampling strategies to balance visual fidelity with computational efficiency.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484174, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 321, "total_tokens": 546, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
