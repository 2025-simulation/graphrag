It functions as a source node, typically serving as the initial entry point for simulation data in workflows such as those implemented in Cubeflow or Blender-integrated VTK environments. The node is defined in the file `generated_nodes/gen_VTKReaders.py` and carries the `bl_idname` identifier `VTKOpenFOAMReaderType`.\n\nThis reader is specifically tailored to handle OpenFOAM case files—commonly referenced with paths like `$/cubeflow/case.foam`—and supports a wide range of configurable properties that control how data is imported and processed. Key configuration options include file path specification, time step selection or handling, data format settings, mesh caching behavior, and precision settings such as the use of 64-bit floating-point numbers. It also provides functionality for managing data arrays, including the ability to enable all patch arrays via custom code methods like `EnableAllPatchArrays()`, and supports operations such as cell-to-point data conversion.\n\nVTKOpenFOAMReader integrates seamlessly into VTK-based data processing pipelines, where it reads native OpenFOAM simulation output and converts it into VTK data structures suitable for visualization, analysis, or further computation. Its design emphasizes flexibility and performance, allowing users to fine-tune data loading behavior based on the requirements of their specific simulation or visualization task. The component is frequently used in advanced workflows, including boundary surface extraction, and is documented as a representative example of how custom code can be incorporated into VTK reader nodes.\n\nIn summary, VTKOpenFOAMReader is a versatile and configurable reader node that bridges OpenFOAM simulation data with the VTK visualization ecosystem, offering robust support for time-varying datasets, mesh handling, and data array management within a modular pipeline architecture.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484152, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 407, "prompt_tokens": 936, "total_tokens": 1343, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
