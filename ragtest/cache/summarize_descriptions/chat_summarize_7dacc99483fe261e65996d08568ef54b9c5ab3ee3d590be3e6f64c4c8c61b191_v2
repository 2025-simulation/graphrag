This node enables users to seamlessly integrate scientific or medical imaging data—commonly represented in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) format—into Blender’s native image handling system. Once converted, the resulting Blender Image can be viewed, manipulated, and utilized within the Blender Image Editor, making it particularly useful for visualization workflows that combine simulation or volumetric data with 3D rendering and animation capabilities. By bridging the gap between VTK’s robust data structures and Blender’s powerful graphics pipeline, this node enhances interoperability for researchers, engineers, and digital artists working across scientific visualization and creative 3D environments.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482521, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 161, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
