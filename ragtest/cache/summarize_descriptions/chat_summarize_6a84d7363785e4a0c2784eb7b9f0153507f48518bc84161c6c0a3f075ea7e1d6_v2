Specifically, VTKPlane provides the CutFunction input to VTKCutter, defining the mathematical representation of an infinite plane in 3D space. This plane acts as the cutting function that VTKCutter uses to intersect and slice through the input dataset—such as polydata, structured grids, or unstructured grids—producing a new output that represents the intersection geometry. In essence, VTKCutter relies on VTKPlane (or another implicit function) to determine where and how to cut the input data, and VTKPlane’s role is to supply the necessary geometric parameters—namely a point on the plane and its normal vector—that fully specify the cutting surface. Together, these two classes enable users to extract cross-sectional views or contours from volumetric or surface data by applying planar slices, which is a common operation in scientific visualization and medical imaging applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484317, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 233, "prompt_tokens": 194, "total_tokens": 427, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
