It enables users to apply custom code logic to input datasets, offering flexibility for specialized data processing tasks that are not covered by standard VTK filters. This node receives input data—often time-selected data from a Time Selector node—and processes it according to user-specified logic before passing the results downstream in the pipeline. Typical downstream consumers of the Custom Filter’s output include nodes such as vtkAssignAttribute and vtkThreshold, which handle attribute assignment and data thresholding, respectively. The Custom Filter thus serves as an intermediary processing step that bridges time-based data selection with subsequent attribute manipulation and filtering operations. In a recent update, the node was enhanced to resolve issues related to tree import and export functionality, improving its reliability and integration within larger VTK-based workflows. By allowing users to inject custom algorithms directly into the visualization pipeline, Custom Filter provides a powerful mechanism for extending VTK’s native capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the broader BVTKNodes architecture.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482441, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 214, "prompt_tokens": 274, "total_tokens": 488, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
