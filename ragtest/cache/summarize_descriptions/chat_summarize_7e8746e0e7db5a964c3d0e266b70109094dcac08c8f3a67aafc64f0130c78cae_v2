It is defined in the module `generated_nodes/gen_VTKSources.py` and provides a configurable set of properties that allow users to control the characteristics of the generated data. Key parameters include `m_Maximum`, which likely defines the upper bounds or resolution of the output dataset, and `m_Center`, which specifies the central point around which the analytic data is generated. Additionally, the class supports frequency and magnitude parameters for each spatial dimension—X, Y, and Z—enabling fine-grained control over the spatial variation and amplitude of the analytic signal or field being produced. By combining these adjustable properties, VTKRTAnalyticSource can create a wide range of procedural datasets that mimic real-world phenomena or stress-test visualization algorithms under controlled conditions. Its role as a synthetic data generator makes it particularly valuable in development and validation workflows where consistent, reproducible input is required without reliance on external data files or capture devices.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484285, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 228, "total_tokens": 445, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
