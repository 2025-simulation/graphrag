This module serves as a centralized digital location—treated analogously to a geographic entity in software architecture—for housing source components used in visualization or simulation frameworks. The file includes implementations for a diverse set of VTK source types, such as `vtkRTAnalyticSource`, `vtkRandomHyperTreeGridSource`, `vtkHyperTreeGridPreConfiguredSource`, `vtkImageGaussianSource`, `VTKCameraHandleSource`, and `VTKConeSource`, among others. These classes represent various data generators within the VTK ecosystem, including analytic, image-based, and geometric sources. The module is specifically designed to encapsulate auto-generated code, streamlining the integration and maintenance of VTK source nodes within the larger software project. As such, `GENERATED_NODES/GEN_VTKSOURCES.PY` plays a critical role in defining the foundational data sources that feed into visualization pipelines, ensuring consistent and programmatic access to synthetic or preconfigured datasets.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482598, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 237, "prompt_tokens": 492, "total_tokens": 729, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
