It operates on mesh elements or field data and enables users to designate particular data arrays (e.g., 'U' or 'p') as active attributes for downstream operations like glyphing, coloring, or probing. This filter is commonly configured via properties such as the object or array name and can redefine how existing arrays are interpreted by the visualization system without altering the underlying data values. For instance, it can promote a generic data array to serve as point data scalars or assign an array as the active vector field to control glyph orientation. vtkAssignAttribute receives input from upstream nodes—such as Custom Filter or Multi Block Leaf—and typically feeds processed data into subsequent filters like vtkProbeFilter. Identified in some implementations by the bl_idname VTKAssignAttributeType, this node plays a critical role in preparing datasets for visualization by explicitly specifying which arrays should be treated as geometric or topological attributes. Its functionality centers on attribute type assignment rather than data transformation, ensuring that visualization algorithms correctly interpret the intended role of each data array within the pipeline.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482380, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 253, "prompt_tokens": 610, "total_tokens": 863, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
