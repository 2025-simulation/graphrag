This reader is specifically engineered to support advanced features such as m_CacheMesh and m_ReadZones, which allow users to control mesh caching behavior and the reading of zone information from OpenFOAM case files, respectively. Notably, vtkPOpenFOAMReader is the parallel variant of the standard OpenFOAM reader in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK), enabling it to efficiently process decomposed OpenFOAM simulation cases—those that have been partitioned across multiple processors for parallel computation. To handle such decomposed data, the reader may require custom code configuration, ensuring compatibility and optimal performance when loading large-scale or distributed simulation outputs. By integrating with VTK’s visualization pipeline, vtkPOpenFOAMReader facilitates the post-processing and analysis of complex CFD results within VTK-based applications, providing researchers and engineers with a robust tool for visualizing time-varying, multi-region, and parallel OpenFOAM simulations.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482481, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 235, "prompt_tokens": 214, "total_tokens": 449, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
