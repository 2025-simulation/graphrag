It operates by tracing paths through vector fields based on user-defined seed points, which can be supplied via various sources such as a plane source or structured grid. Implemented as a node within a visualization pipeline—specifically defined in the module generated_nodes/gen_VTKFilters2.py—it is identified by the bl_idname VTKStreamTracerType, indicating its integration into a node-based system, likely within a Blender-based or similar visual programming environment.\n\nThe functionality of VTKSTREAMTRACER centers on streamline computation, which involves integrating the vector field along trajectories starting from seed points. This process is governed by a set of configurable parameters that control the accuracy and extent of the tracing. These include integration step size, maximum propagation distance or time, and termination criteria to limit streamline length. Additionally, the filter supports advanced features such as vorticity computation, which can provide insights into rotational characteristics of the flow field.\n\nAs a core component of VTK’s filtering infrastructure, VTKSTREAMTRACER plays a key role in visualizing complex fluid dynamics, electromagnetic fields, or any domain where vector field analysis is required. By accepting vector field data—typically defined on structured grids or other mesh types—and seed geometry as inputs, it outputs streamline geometry that can be rendered or further processed. The filter’s flexibility in handling different seed configurations and integration settings makes it suitable for both qualitative exploration and quantitative analysis in scientific computing applications.\n\nIn summary, VTKSTREAMTRACER is a versatile and configurable VTK filter designed for streamline generation in vector fields, supporting a range of input sources and integration parameters, and implemented as a node within a larger visualization framework for use in scientific and engineering visualization tasks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484240, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 664, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
