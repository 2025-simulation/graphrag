It functions by applying a lookup table—often sourced from a connected Color Ramp node—to translate numerical data attributes into corresponding colors for rendering purposes. This node allows users to define how data is colored through properties such as \"color_by,\" which specifies the data array or attribute to map, and may also support custom code for advanced color mapping logic. Typically integrated within visualization workflows, Color Mapper connects to other VTK components such as vtkCutter and receives input from nodes that provide scalar data or texture settings. Its primary role is to enhance data interpretability by converting abstract numerical values into intuitive color gradients, making it a key element in scientific and engineering visualizations where scalar fields—such as temperature, pressure, or velocity—need to be visually represented. The node consistently operates using a lookup table mechanism, ensuring a coherent and flexible approach to color assignment based on selected data arrays or scalar attributes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484158, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 204, "prompt_tokens": 393, "total_tokens": 597, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
