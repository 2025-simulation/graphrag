It serves as an output node in visualization workflows, converting various VTK data structures—including polygonal data (polydata), unstructured grids, structured grids, and general VTK datasets—into native Blender mesh geometry suitable for 3D rendering, modeling, or further manipulation within Blender’s environment.\n\nThis node replaces an earlier implementation known as “VTK To Blender” and includes enhanced functionality for mesh conversion. It supports configurable properties such as a user-defined name for the resulting Blender object and offers optional features like automatic material generation (required for displaying color data from VTK) and mesh smoothing. The node can extract all boundary surfaces from input VTK data and is designed to integrate seamlessly into Blender scenes by producing standard mesh objects recognized by Blender’s internal systems.\n\nAs a terminal component in the VTK-to-Blender pipeline, VTK To Blender Mesh does not produce further VTK output but instead finalizes the data flow by delivering geometry ready for visualization or editing in Blender. It is identified internally by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_VTKToBlenderMeshType` and typically receives input from upstream VTK processing nodes, such as `vtkPolyDataReader`. The node is specifically engineered for compatibility with Blender’s 3D graphics environment, ensuring that simulation results, contour outputs, and other VTK visualization data are accurately represented as editable and renderable mesh objects.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482392, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 333, "prompt_tokens": 1440, "total_tokens": 1773, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
