It functions as a filter in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) ecosystem, enabling users to define and evaluate custom mathematical expressions on existing field data to produce new derived arrays. For example, it can compute the magnitude of a vector field such as 'U' and store the result in a new array named 'magU'. This node is integrated into processing pipelines—such as the Cubeflow pipeline—where it is identified by the bl_idname `VTKArrayCalculatorType` and includes multiple calculation-related properties along with support for custom code via an extra parameter. As a versatile processing unit, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR allows users to generate new field data from existing arrays through user-defined functions, facilitating advanced data analysis and visualization workflows. Its core capability lies in evaluating mathematical expressions applied to scalar or vector data arrays, making it a key tool for computing derived quantities in scientific and engineering simulations that rely on VTK data structures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484202, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 213, "prompt_tokens": 374, "total_tokens": 587, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
