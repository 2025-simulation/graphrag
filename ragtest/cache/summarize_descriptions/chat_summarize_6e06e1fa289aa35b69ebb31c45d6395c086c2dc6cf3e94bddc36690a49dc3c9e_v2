In the updated tkeskita/bvtknodes version, VTK To Blender Mesh supersedes the original VTK To Blender node, effectively replacing it as the preferred tool for converting VTK (Visualization Toolkit) data into Blender-compatible mesh formats. Both nodes serve the purpose of bridging VTK-based scientific visualization data with Blender’s 3D modeling and rendering environment, but VTK To Blender Mesh offers refinements and additional features that build upon the foundational functionality of the original. This evolution reflects a commitment to streamlining workflows for users who rely on interoperability between scientific data visualization and 3D graphics creation. As a result, users of the tkeskita/bvtknodes add-on are encouraged to adopt VTK To Blender Mesh for more robust and up-to-date performance.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482746, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 394, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
