This node enables users to interact with complex datasets that are organized into multiple blocks—such as those commonly generated in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or other multi-domain simulations—by providing access to individual components within the hierarchical structure. Specifically, BVTK_Node_MultiBlockLeafType is capable of targeting and extracting a particular block (for example, a block named 'internalMesh') from the broader multi-block dataset. This functionality is essential for focused visualization tasks where only a subset of the full data is relevant or required for analysis or rendering. By allowing selective access to specific leaf-level blocks within the multi-block hierarchy, the node enhances workflow efficiency and precision in Blender-based visualization pipelines that integrate with VTK (Visualization Toolkit) data structures.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482546, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 185, "prompt_tokens": 212, "total_tokens": 397, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
