This node typically receives processed data as input and outputs metadata or summary details that characterize the dataset’s structure, properties, or state. Its primary function is to aid in debugging, monitoring, or understanding the data as it moves through various stages of the visualization or processing workflow. By exposing attributes such as data dimensions, data types, array names, or other relevant statistics, the INFO node serves as a utility for developers and users to inspect and validate the integrity and content of their data without altering it. While the exact implementation may vary, its role remains consistent: to act as a non-modifying observer that enhances transparency and facilitates informed decision-making within the VTK pipeline architecture.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484256, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 172, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 350, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
