As a specialized VTK filter module, it operates on smoothed image data—often received from a preceding node such as vtkImageGaussianSmooth—and outputs the resulting geometry to a VTK-to-Blender mesh converter for visualization within Blender. The node is implemented in the custom_nodes/VTKFilters.py file and is designed to support both static and animated visualizations, with the ability to keyframe contour parameters for animation purposes.\n\nThe filter computes isocontours based on user-specified scalar values—examples include contour values of 0.02 and 0.023—and can be configured to calculate additional geometric properties such as surface normals, gradients, and scalar attributes. It supports the generation of either contour lines (in 2D contexts) or fully triangulated 3D surfaces, depending on the input data and settings. Key configurable properties include the number of contours, specific isovalues, and options for triangle generation, allowing users to tailor the output geometry to their visualization needs.\n\nIntegrated into Blender via the BVTKNodes add-on, VTKContourFilter serves as a bridge between VTK’s powerful scientific visualization capabilities and Blender’s 3D modeling and rendering environment. This enables users to process and visualize complex volumetric datasets—such as those from medical imaging or simulation outputs—directly within a familiar creative workflow. Its role as a customizable, keyframable node makes it particularly useful for dynamic scientific visualizations where contour thresholds may change over time.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482389, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 413, "total_tokens": 745, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
