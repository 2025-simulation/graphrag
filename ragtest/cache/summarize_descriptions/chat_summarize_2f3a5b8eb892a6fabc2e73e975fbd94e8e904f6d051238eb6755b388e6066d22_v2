It functions as a source node that produces polygonal arrow-shaped glyphs, which are commonly employed in vector field visualizations to represent direction and magnitude. The geometry generated by VTKArrowSource is specifically designed for use with glyphing filters such as vtkGlyph3D, where it serves as the representative shape for vector data.\n\nThis source object allows users to customize key aspects of the arrow’s appearance, including the dimensions and resolution of both the shaft and the tip, enabling tailored visual representations suited to specific datasets or aesthetic requirements. As a node type defined in generated VTK node files—such as those found in generated_nodes/gen_VTKSources.py—it integrates seamlessly into VTK workflow systems, providing a standardized and configurable means of producing arrow glyphs.\n\nVTKArrowSource is consistently described across multiple sources as a fundamental building block in scientific visualization pipelines, particularly for applications requiring intuitive depiction of vector quantities, such as fluid flow, electromagnetic fields, or gradient directions. Its output is a polygonal dataset representing a single 3D arrow, which can then be replicated, scaled, oriented, and positioned by downstream glyph filters according to vector data attributes.\n\nIn summary, VTKArrowSource is a versatile and configurable VTK source node that generates a 3D arrow geometry used primarily as a glyph in vector visualization. It plays a critical role in transforming abstract vector data into visually interpretable directional indicators within VTK-based visualization frameworks.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482424, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 314, "prompt_tokens": 386, "total_tokens": 700, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
