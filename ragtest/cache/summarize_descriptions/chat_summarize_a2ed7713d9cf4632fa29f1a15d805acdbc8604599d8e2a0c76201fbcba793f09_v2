It operates by tracing paths—known as streamlines—through a vector field using specified seed points or seed sources, which can include structured grids or plane sources as input. The component is implemented as a VTK algorithm and is accessible as a node in visualization pipelines, particularly within environments that utilize generated VTK node wrappers, such as those defined in the module generated_nodes/gen_VTKFilters2.py, where it is identified by the bl_idname VTKStreamTracerType.\n\nVTKStreamTracer offers a range of configurable parameters that allow users to control the streamline computation process in detail. These include integration step size, propagation limits (such as maximum integration time or distance), and options for advanced computations like vorticity. These settings enable precise control over the accuracy and extent of the resulting streamlines, making the filter suitable for a variety of applications in computational fluid dynamics, meteorology, and other fields that rely on vector field analysis.\n\nAs a core VTK filter, VTKStreamTracer integrates seamlessly into VTK-based visualization systems and is commonly used to visualize the direction and behavior of flow within vector datasets. Its functionality is consistent across descriptions: it takes vector field data as input, uses seed geometry to initiate streamline tracing, and outputs streamline geometry that represents the integrated paths through the field. There are no contradictions among the provided descriptions; rather, they collectively emphasize its role as a configurable, algorithmic filter within the VTK framework for streamline generation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482495, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 340, "prompt_tokens": 369, "total_tokens": 709, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
