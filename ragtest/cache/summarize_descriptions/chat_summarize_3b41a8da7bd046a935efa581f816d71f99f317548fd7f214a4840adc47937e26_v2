The Time Selector functions as a time-filtering component that receives multi-block input data and allows users to select one or more specific timesteps. It then outputs this time-filtered, multi-block dataset to the Multi Block Leaf node. The primary role of the Time Selector is to isolate data corresponding to chosen temporal points, ensuring that only relevant time-specific information is passed downstream for further processing.\n\nThe Multi Block Leaf node receives the time-filtered multi-block data from the Time Selector and performs hierarchical data processing to extract individual blocks or leaf-level datasets from the structured multi-block hierarchy. A common use case involves extracting a specific mesh block, such as the 'internalMesh', which represents the core computational domain in many simulation frameworks. The Multi Block Leaf is designed to navigate the block structure of the input data and isolate the desired component—whether referred to as a “block,” “leaf block,” or “leaf-level dataset”—based on user configuration.\n\nTogether, the Time Selector and Multi Block Leaf enable a two-stage extraction process: first, temporal selection of relevant simulation timesteps, followed by spatial or structural selection of specific data blocks within those timesteps. This workflow supports efficient and targeted analysis of large, complex datasets by reducing both temporal and structural scope. All descriptions consistently affirm that the Time Selector outputs time-specific or time-filtered data to the Multi Block Leaf, which then carries out the actual block or dataset extraction. There are no contradictions among the provided descriptions; instead, they reinforce a coherent operational sequence where the Time Selector precedes and feeds into the Multi Block Leaf in a unidirectional data flow.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482622, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 348, "prompt_tokens": 637, "total_tokens": 985, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
