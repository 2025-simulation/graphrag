It functions as a processing node in visualization and data analysis pipelines—such as the Cubeflow pipeline—where it is identified by the bl_idname `VTKArrayCalculatorType`. This node enables users to define custom mathematical expressions that operate on existing point or cell data arrays to generate new derived field data. For instance, it can compute the magnitude of a vector field; a common example involves calculating a new scalar array named 'magU' from an existing vector array 'U' defined on point data. The node supports a range of calculation-related properties and accepts user-defined functions or expressions as input, allowing flexible and dynamic data transformation. Its core functionality centers on evaluating mathematical expressions applied to input VTK data arrays and outputting the results as new arrays, which can then be used for further processing, visualization, or analysis. As a VTK filter, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR integrates seamlessly into VTK’s pipeline architecture, operating on structured or unstructured datasets and maintaining compatibility with VTK’s data model. It is particularly useful in scientific computing and simulation post-processing workflows where derived quantities—such as velocity magnitude, vorticity, or custom combinations of physical variables—need to be computed on-the-fly from raw simulation or experimental data.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482441, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 281, "prompt_tokens": 384, "total_tokens": 665, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
