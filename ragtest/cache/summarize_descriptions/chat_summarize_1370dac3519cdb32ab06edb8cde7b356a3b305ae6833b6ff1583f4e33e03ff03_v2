This filter generates cross-sectional geometry from the input data by intersecting it with the cutting function. The resulting output typically consists of contour lines or surfaces that represent the intersection of the input geometry with the specified cut plane. vtkCutter supports the creation of both contour lines and triangulated surfaces, depending on configuration settings. However, certain parameters may need to be explicitly managed; for instance, to achieve specific output types, users might need to disable options such as GenerateCutScalars and GenerateTriangles. The filter operates on a variety of input dataset types and is particularly useful in scientific visualization for revealing internal structures or creating slices through volumetric or surface data. As an implicit-function-based cutter, vtkCutter is flexible and can theoretically work with any implicit function (e.g., spheres, cylinders), though in practice it is most frequently employed with planar cuts. The node processes field data and geometric representations alike, making it a versatile tool in VTK-based data processing pipelines for generating cross-sectional views or extracting boundary contours at specified locations within the dataset.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482400, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 524, "total_tokens": 770, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
