This filter operates on datasets—often mesh-based—and allows users to designate a particular data array (e.g., an array named 'U') as the active attribute for downstream operations, such as glyph orientation. It is commonly employed to ensure that visualization modules correctly interpret which array should be treated as a vector field, scalar field, or other attribute type.\n\nThe node is configurable via properties such as the object name, enabling users to specify which input array should be reassigned or promoted. It can both assign new attributes and rename or reclassify existing ones within dataset arrays. VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE receives input from various upstream sources, including Custom Filter nodes or Multi Block Leaf data structures, and typically feeds its output into subsequent processing nodes like vtkProbeFilter. \n\nFunctionally, VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE plays a critical role in preparing data for visualization by explicitly defining how arrays should be interpreted within the VTK pipeline. Its bl_idname is identified as VTKAssignAttributeType, aligning it with Blender’s VTK integration framework where applicable. Overall, it serves as a versatile and essential component for managing data attribute semantics in scientific visualization workflows built on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484152, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 286, "prompt_tokens": 436, "total_tokens": 722, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
