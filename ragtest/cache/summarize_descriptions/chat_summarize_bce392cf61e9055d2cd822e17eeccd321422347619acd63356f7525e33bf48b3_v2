It generates simulation data—including specific datasets such as the cubeflow dataset—that are commonly employed in scientific visualization workflows. The output from OPENFOAM simulations can be read and processed using VTK-based (Visualization Toolkit) nodes, enabling integration with a variety of visualization and analysis tools. This interoperability supports researchers and engineers in exploring and interpreting complex fluid dynamics results through advanced graphical representations. As an open-source platform, OPENFOAM provides users with extensive flexibility to customize solvers, modify simulation parameters, and extend functionality, making it a popular choice in both academic and industrial CFD applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482470, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 149, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 352, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
