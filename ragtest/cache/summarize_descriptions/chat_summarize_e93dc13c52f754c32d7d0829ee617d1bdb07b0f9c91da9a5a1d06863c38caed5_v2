It is implemented in the file custom_nodes/VTKOthers.py as a specialized node type and serves as a geometric representation of a plane through two key parameters: a normal vector and an origin point. This plane definition enables its use as an implicit function—meaning it can compute signed distances from any point in space to the plane—which is essential for operations like dataset slicing or volumetric clipping.\n\nThe VTKPlane node is commonly employed as input to the vtkCutter filter, where it acts as a cutting function to extract cross-sectional geometry from 3D datasets such as meshes or volumetric grids. Its role as an implicit function allows it to interact seamlessly with other VTK filters that require planar constraints or spatial queries. The plane is mathematically defined by the equation **n · (x − o) = 0**, where **n** is the normal vector, **o** is the origin point, and **x** is any point on the plane.\n\nIn practical applications, particularly within integrated environments like Blender with VTK extensions, VTKPlane can be configured either through direct manual input of the normal and origin values or by linking to external objects (e.g., Blender empties or transform nodes) to dynamically control the plane’s position and orientation. This flexibility makes it a versatile tool for interactive visualization and analysis workflows.\n\nOverall, VTKPlane is a foundational geometric utility in VTK pipelines, enabling precise and efficient planar operations on 3D data through its simple yet powerful parameterization via origin and normal vector.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484168, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 354, "prompt_tokens": 418, "total_tokens": 772, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
