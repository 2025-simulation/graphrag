It functions by extracting specific portions of a dataset based on user-defined attribute value thresholds, typically specified using parameters such as Value1 and Value2. This node operates as a VTK filter, selectively passing through only those elements of the input dataset whose associated attribute values fall within the defined threshold range.\n\nWithin the BVTKNodes architecture, VTKThreshold is implemented as a software class and is located in the file 'custom_nodes/VTKFilters.py'. It is designed to integrate seamlessly into custom VTK pipeline workflows, where it commonly receives input from a Custom Filter node and subsequently feeds its processed output into downstream nodes such as vtkBoxClipDataSet. This positioning underscores its role as an intermediary filtering step that refines datasets before further geometric or topological operations are applied.\n\nThe primary purpose of VTKThreshold is to enable users to isolate regions of interest within complex datasets—such as simulation results or scientific visualizations—by filtering based on scalar, vector, or other attribute data. Its implementation adheres to standard VTK conventions while being adapted for use in the BVTKNodes environment, which facilitates node-based visual programming with VTK components in platforms like Blender. By allowing precise control over data inclusion through threshold parameters, VTKThreshold enhances the flexibility and analytical power of VTK-based visualization pipelines.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484207, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 302, "prompt_tokens": 277, "total_tokens": 579, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
