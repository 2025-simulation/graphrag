This software component is part of the VTK framework and is specifically implemented in the module generated_nodes/gen_VTKFilters2.py. The class enables users to monitor and retrieve specific arrays of interest across multiple timesteps, making it particularly useful for temporal data analysis and visualization workflows. Among its configurable properties are m_ReportStatisticsOnly, which controls whether the filter outputs only statistical summaries of the selected arrays rather than the full time-series data, and m_ObjectName, which allows the user to specify or identify the object associated with the extraction process. As a generated node within the VTK pipeline architecture, VTKExtractSelectedArraysOverTime integrates seamlessly with other VTK filters and data sources, supporting automated and scripted scientific visualization tasks. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the focused analysis of time-dependent simulation or experimental data by isolating user-specified arrays and tracking their evolution over time.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482580, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 206, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 437, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
