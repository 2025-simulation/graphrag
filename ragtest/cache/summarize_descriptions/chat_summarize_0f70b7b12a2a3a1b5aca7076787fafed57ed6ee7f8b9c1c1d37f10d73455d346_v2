Specifically, it processes VTK point data—which typically includes spatial coordinates and associated attributes—and translates this information into a format compatible with Blender’s native particle system. This enables users to visualize complex simulation or experimental data, such as fluid flow or particle trajectories, directly within Blender’s rendering and animation environment. The node supports key parameters that enhance its functionality and customization, including the ability to specify an object name (commonly set to 'particles') and to map vector fields—such as a velocity field denoted by 'U'—to influence particle behavior, orientation, or motion within the Blender scene. By focusing on point-based VTK datasets, the node ensures accurate representation of discrete data points as individual particles, preserving their original positions and associated vector or scalar properties. This makes VTK To Blender Particles particularly useful in scientific visualization, where fidelity to the source data is critical, while also leveraging Blender’s powerful rendering capabilities for high-quality visual output.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484265, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 225, "prompt_tokens": 221, "total_tokens": 446, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
