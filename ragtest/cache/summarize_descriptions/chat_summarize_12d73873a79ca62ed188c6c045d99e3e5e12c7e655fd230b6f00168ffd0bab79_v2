It is defined in the file `custom_nodes/VTKFilters.py` and functions as a VTK node designed to apply a range of geometric transformations to input data. These transformations include rotation, scaling, and translation, allowing users to manipulate the spatial properties of datasets within the pipeline. As a VTK filter class, VTKTransformFilter integrates seamlessly into VTK’s architecture, enabling the modification of geometry without altering the underlying data structure. The node exposes configurable properties for scale, rotation, and translation, providing users with fine-grained control over how the input data is transformed. This makes it a versatile tool for tasks requiring spatial adjustments, such as aligning datasets, adjusting object sizes, or reorienting geometries within a 3D scene. Consistently described across multiple sources as a node that applies geometric operations, VTKTransformFilter serves as a key component in custom VTK workflows where dynamic spatial manipulation of data is required.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484216, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 216, "prompt_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 491, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
