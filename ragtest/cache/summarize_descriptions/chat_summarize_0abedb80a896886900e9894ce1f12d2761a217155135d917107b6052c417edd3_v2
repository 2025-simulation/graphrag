It serves as a core component used by the Color Mapper to assign colors based on data values, enabling effective representation of field or scalar data in rendered visualizations. The node supports customization through user-defined parameters and can incorporate textures or color gradients as the basis for its mapping. It offers flexibility by including presets derived from matplotlib, allowing users to quickly apply established color schemes. Additionally, the Color Ramp node can accommodate up to 32 discrete color samples, providing sufficient resolution for nuanced data representation. Functionally, it operates within VTK-based visualization workflows, generating a lookup table that translates numerical input ranges into a continuous or segmented spectrum of colors. This capability makes it essential for scientific visualization tasks where accurate and intuitive color encoding of data is critical. The node may also feature custom code and texture name attributes, further enhancing its adaptability to specific visualization needs. Overall, Color Ramp acts as a bridge between raw scalar data and its visual interpretation, ensuring that data-driven color mapping is both precise and visually meaningful in the rendering pipeline.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484158, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 246, "prompt_tokens": 395, "total_tokens": 641, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
