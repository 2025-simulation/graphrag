It is part of the broader VTK (Visualization Toolkit) readers infrastructure, specifically implemented in the file generated_nodes/gen_VTKReaders.py. This component enables the reading and processing of complex, multi-resolution or multi-block data structures commonly used in scientific visualization. Key properties of VTKXMLHierarchicalDataReader include support for file input—allowing it to load hierarchical data from specified XML-based files—and configuration of time steps, which facilitates the handling of time-varying datasets. By integrating into VTK’s modular architecture, VTKXMLHierarchicalDataReader provides a standardized interface for applications requiring access to hierarchical data representations, ensuring compatibility with VTK’s pipeline and data processing workflows.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484279, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 158, "prompt_tokens": 205, "total_tokens": 363, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
