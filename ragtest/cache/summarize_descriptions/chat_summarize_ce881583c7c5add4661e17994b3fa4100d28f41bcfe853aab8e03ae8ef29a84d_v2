It is designed to perform additional array computations beyond those handled by the first instance of the node. This node is identified by the bl_idname \"VTKArrayCalculatorType\" and is equipped with multiple calculation-related properties that allow users to define and customize mathematical operations on data arrays. Additionally, it supports a custom code extra parameter, enabling advanced users to input bespoke computational logic directly. As part of the broader VTK (Visualization Toolkit) integration in the pipeline, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001 plays a critical role in extending data processing capabilities by enabling on-the-fly array manipulations, thereby facilitating more complex and tailored visualization or analysis workflows.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482539, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 159, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 366, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
