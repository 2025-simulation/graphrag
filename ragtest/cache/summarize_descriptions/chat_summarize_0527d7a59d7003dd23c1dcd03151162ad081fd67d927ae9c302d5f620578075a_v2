Identified by the `bl_idname` `BVTK_Node_TimeSelectorType`, it functions as a filtering node that enables temporal slicing of datasets by allowing users to specify which time step(s) to extract for downstream processing. The node typically receives input from a time-series data reader such as `vtkOpenFOAMReader` and passes the selected temporal slice to subsequent nodes, such as a Custom Filter.\n\nThe TIME SELECTOR supports configuration through parameters like `time_index`, which determines the specific time step to extract from the input data. Descriptions indicate that this parameter can be set to various values—examples include index 1 or index 5—depending on the user’s needs, demonstrating its flexibility. Additionally, the node may include advanced options such as `use_scene_time` and `custom_code`, enhancing its integration within Blender-based VTK workflows.\n\nAs a core component in VTK/Blender data pipelines, the TIME SELECTOR plays a critical role in managing time-dependent simulation outputs, allowing users to isolate and process individual time steps from complex, multi-timestep datasets. It is consistently described as a filter that operates on time-varying simulation data, enabling focused analysis or visualization of specific moments in a simulation sequence. Its placement in the pipeline is typically downstream of data readers and upstream of further processing or rendering nodes, ensuring that only the desired temporal data progresses through the workflow.\n\nIn summary, TIME SELECTOR is a configurable, time-index-driven filtering node in VTK-based pipelines designed to extract user-specified time steps from time-series simulation data, commonly used in conjunction with `vtkOpenFOAMReader` and integrated into Blender via the BVTKNodes system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482384, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 371, "prompt_tokens": 947, "total_tokens": 1318, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
