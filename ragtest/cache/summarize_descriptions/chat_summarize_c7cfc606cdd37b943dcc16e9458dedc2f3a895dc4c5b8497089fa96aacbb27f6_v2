It functions as a structured image data supplier, generating or providing vtkImageData—VTK’s native representation for regular, rectilinear 3D image or volume datasets composed of voxels. This node is specifically designed to serve as an input source for downstream operations, including probing, filtering, and volumetric rendering.\n\nWithin the Cubeflow pipeline, the VTKImageData Object Source is implemented as a custom node with the identifier bl_idname BVTK_Node_ImageDataObjectSourceType and supports additional user-defined parameters through custom code. Its primary role is to produce structured 3D image data with defined dimensions, origin, and spacing, ensuring compatibility with other VTK-based processing nodes. The generated data typically represents scalar or vector fields sampled on a regular grid, making it suitable for applications such as medical imaging, scientific visualization, and computational simulation.\n\nA key use case for this node involves feeding structured volumetric data into vtkProbeFilter or similar components that require sampling of field values at specific points. To ensure accurate probing, the sampling points must align with voxel centers, emphasizing the importance of precise spatial configuration in the data it supplies. As a source node, it does not depend on upstream data inputs but instead originates the dataset within the pipeline, enabling the construction of complex visualization workflows from synthesized or preloaded image data.\n\nIn summary, the VTKImageData Object Source is a foundational component in VTK-integrated systems, providing structured, voxel-based 3D image data to support a range of visualization and analysis tasks within modular, node-based environments like Cubeflow in Blender.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482452, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 347, "prompt_tokens": 415, "total_tokens": 762, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
