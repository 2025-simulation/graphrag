This module contains auto-generated or programmatically defined reader node types designed to support a wide variety of data formats and simulation outputs. The VTK readers implemented in this file include, but are not limited to: HDR, IOSS, ISI, and Image readers; VTKFacetReader, VTKFixedWidthTextReader, VTKGAMBITReader, VTKGESignaReader, and VTKGLTFReader; TIFF, TRUCHAS, Table, Tecplot, and TecplotTable readers; VTKGraphReader, VTKH5PartReader, VTKH5RageReader, VTKHDFReader, and VTKHDRReader; vtkOpenFOAMReader, vtkPChacoReader, vtkPDBReader, vtkPDataSetReader, and vtkPExodusIIReader; as well as VTKVolume16Reader and VTKWindBladeReader. These classes enable the software system to parse and load diverse scientific and engineering data formats into VTK-compatible structures for visualization and analysis. The file is treated as a key architectural component in the software’s data ingestion pipeline, functioning as a digital reference point where VTK reader node definitions are either auto-generated or manually implemented to ensure compatibility with the broader visualization framework. Its role is critical in abstracting format-specific reading logic into standardized node interfaces, thereby facilitating modularity and extensibility within the system.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484284, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 326, "prompt_tokens": 657, "total_tokens": 983, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
