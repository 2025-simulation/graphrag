It functions as a key component in rendering pipelines by applying color mapping to input data based on selected scalar array attributes. The node utilizes a lookup table—typically sourced from a connected Color Ramp node—to translate numerical data values into corresponding colors, enabling intuitive visual interpretation of field or attribute data. This lookup table can be customized through user-defined settings or custom code, and the resulting colored output is often passed downstream to other nodes such as “VTK To Blender Mesh.001” for final mesh rendering. The Color Mapper supports various coloring strategies and may incorporate texture settings to enhance visual representation. Its primary role is to bridge raw scientific or simulation data with visual aesthetics by assigning colors according to data magnitude or category, making it essential for data-driven visualization workflows in Blender environments that leverage VTK (Visualization Toolkit) capabilities.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482392, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 690, "total_tokens": 884, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
