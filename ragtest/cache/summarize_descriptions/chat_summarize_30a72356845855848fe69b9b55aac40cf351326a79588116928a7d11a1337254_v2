It functions sequentially after the initial Multi Block Leaf node and is specifically employed to further process multi-block simulation data. Its primary role involves refining the selection of blocks within the dataset, building upon the work of the preceding node to enhance precision or granularity in the processing pipeline. As a duplicate or follow-up instance, MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001 ensures that complex multi-block structures are handled iteratively, allowing for more detailed analysis or manipulation in subsequent stages of the workflow. This node is integral to pipelines where hierarchical or staged block processing is required, enabling more sophisticated data refinement than a single leaf node could achieve alone.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482543, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 151, "prompt_tokens": 200, "total_tokens": 351, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
