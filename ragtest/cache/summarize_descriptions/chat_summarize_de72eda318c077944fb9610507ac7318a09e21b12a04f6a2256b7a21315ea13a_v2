This addon was developed to bridge the capabilities of the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) with Blender, enabling powerful scientific visualization workflows within Blender’s 3D creation environment. During the conference, the integration of VTK and Blender through BVTKNodes was highlighted as a novel approach to leveraging Blender not only for artistic and animation purposes but also for scientific and engineering data visualization. The presentation showcased how users could utilize the addon to import, process, and render complex scientific datasets directly in Blender, thereby expanding the software’s utility into technical and research-oriented domains. The event served as the official unveiling of BVTKNodes to the broader community, marking an important milestone in the convergence of open-source 3D graphics and scientific computing tools.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482526, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
