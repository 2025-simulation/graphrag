This node serves as one of the final output components in a VTK processing pipeline, converting VTK-formatted data into native Blender mesh geometry suitable for 3D rendering, modeling, and visualization. It replaces an earlier node, \"VTK To Blender,\" offering improved mesh conversion capabilities. The node is identified by the Blender internal identifier (bl_idname) BVTK_Node_VTKToBlenderMeshType. It includes a configurable name property, allowing users to define the name of the resulting mesh object in Blender. Additionally, to properly display color information from the original VTK data, the \"Generate Material\" option must be enabled. The node can extract all boundary surfaces from VTK datasets and supports material and smoothing options for enhanced visual fidelity. Functionally, it acts as a bridge between scientific visualization data in VTK format and Blender’s 3D graphics environment, enabling seamless integration of simulation or analytical results into creative or engineering workflows.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484159, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 263, "prompt_tokens": 894, "total_tokens": 1157, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
