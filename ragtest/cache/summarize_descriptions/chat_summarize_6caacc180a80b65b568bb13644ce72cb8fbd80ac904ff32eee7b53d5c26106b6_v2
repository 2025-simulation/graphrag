OpenVDB is an open-source C++ library developed for efficiently storing and manipulating sparse volumetric data, commonly used in visual effects and simulation pipelines. Blender, a widely used open-source 3D creation suite, leverages this format by allowing users to directly import OpenVDB files into its scene environment. Once imported, the data is represented as a Volume Object, which can be rendered using Blender’s Principled Volume Shader—a physically based shader designed to accurately simulate the scattering, absorption, and emission properties of volumetric media such as smoke, fire, and clouds. This integration facilitates a seamless exchange of high-resolution volumetric data between simulation tools that export to OpenVDB (such as Houdini or other fluid solvers) and Blender’s rendering engine, Cycles or Eevee, enhancing Blender’s capabilities in visual effects and scientific visualization. The synergy between OpenVDB and Blender thus empowers artists and technical directors to incorporate complex, simulation-driven volumetric elements into their 3D scenes with greater fidelity and efficiency.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484352, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 189, "total_tokens": 425, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
