It is commonly employed to visualize vector fields, directional data, or other point-based attributes by mapping data values to the orientation, scale, and type of glyph rendered. The filter accepts input point data and, optionally, associated vector or scalar information that dictates how each glyph is transformed. For instance, vector data can determine the direction in which an arrow glyph points, while scalar values may control its size or color. vtkGlyph3D supports a high degree of customization, allowing users to define the source geometry for the glyph (e.g., a cone, sphere, or custom mesh), specify scaling behavior (including uniform or non-uniform scaling), and choose whether glyph orientation follows input vectors. This capability makes it particularly valuable in scientific visualization applications where representing flow direction, force vectors, or other spatially varying vector quantities is essential. By combining geometric representation with data-driven transformation, vtkGlyph3D provides an intuitive and powerful means of conveying complex multidimensional data in a visually interpretable format.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484179, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 235, "prompt_tokens": 264, "total_tokens": 499, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
