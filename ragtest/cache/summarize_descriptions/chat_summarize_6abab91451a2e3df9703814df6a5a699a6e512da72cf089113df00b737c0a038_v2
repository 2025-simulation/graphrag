Implemented as a VTK node with the identifier bl_idname VTKPlaneSourceType, it is defined in the file generated_nodes/gen_VTKSources.py and functions as a geometric source within VTK pipelines. The planar surface it produces is fully customizable through several key parameters: it can be defined by an origin (or center), two points (point1 and point2) that establish the plane’s orientation and extent, or alternatively by a center, a normal vector, and resolution settings. Specifically, the node exposes properties such as m_XResolution and m_YResolution, which control the discretization of the plane along its two principal axes, thereby determining the density of the generated mesh. This results in a structured grid of points arranged in a rectangular or square layout, forming a polygonal mesh suitable for seeding particle paths in vector field visualization. The generated planar grid serves as a foundational element in computational fluid dynamics and scientific visualization, where streamlines are traced from these seed points to illustrate flow behavior. Across all descriptions, VTKPlaneSource is consistently characterized as a versatile and essential VTK source object for creating planar geometries tailored for use in streamline-based analysis.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482492, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 279, "prompt_tokens": 385, "total_tokens": 664, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
