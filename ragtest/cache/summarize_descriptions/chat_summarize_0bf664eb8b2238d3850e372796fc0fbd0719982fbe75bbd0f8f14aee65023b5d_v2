It is identified by the Blender internal node type identifier (bl_idname) \"VTKArrayCalculatorType.\" This node is specifically configured to perform an additional or subsequent calculation step in the data processing workflow, building upon prior operations in the pipeline. Like other VTKArrayCalculator nodes, it supports multiple calculation-related properties that allow users to define mathematical expressions, select input arrays, and specify output array names and data types. Additionally, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001 includes a custom code extra parameter, enabling advanced users to incorporate tailored logic or extended functionality beyond standard calculator operations. Its role as a secondary instance suggests it operates downstream of an initial VTKArrayCalculator node, likely refining or transforming data further based on the results of earlier computations. This design supports modular and layered data processing, which is essential in complex visualization or simulation pipelines such as those managed by Cubeflow.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484242, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 207, "prompt_tokens": 207, "total_tokens": 414, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
