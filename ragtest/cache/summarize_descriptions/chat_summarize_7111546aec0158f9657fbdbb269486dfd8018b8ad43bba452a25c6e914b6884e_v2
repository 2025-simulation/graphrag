It functions as a source node, typically serving as the initial data input in workflows such as those in Cubeflow or Blender-integrated VTK environments. The node is defined in the file `generated_nodes/gen_VTKReaders.py` and carries the `bl_idname` identifier `VTKOpenFOAMReaderType`.\n\nThis reader is specifically configured to load OpenFOAM case files, commonly referenced with a path such as `$/cubeflow/case.foam`. It supports a variety of configurable properties that allow users to control how simulation data is processed and visualized. These properties include file path specification, time step selection or handling, data format options (such as precision settings, including support for 64-bit floats), and mesh-related behaviors like mesh caching. Additionally, the node offers capabilities such as enabling all patch arrays via custom methods like `EnableAllPatchArrays()` and performing data conversions like cell-to-point interpolation.\n\nVTKOpenFOAMReader integrates seamlessly into VTK-based pipelines, enabling the loading of complex OpenFOAM simulation outputs—including mesh geometry and field data—into a format suitable for visualization, analysis, and further processing. Its design emphasizes flexibility, allowing users to tailor data ingestion to specific simulation requirements. The node is also referenced in documentation examples, such as those involving boundary surface extraction, highlighting its utility in practical CFD post-processing tasks. Overall, VTKOpenFOAMReader serves as a critical bridge between OpenFOAM simulation results and VTK-powered visualization ecosystems.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482384, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 358, "prompt_tokens": 1052, "total_tokens": 1410, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
