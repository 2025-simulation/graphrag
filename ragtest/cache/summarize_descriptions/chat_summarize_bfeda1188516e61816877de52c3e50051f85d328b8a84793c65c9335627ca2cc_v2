This repository serves as a fork and enhancement of the original BVTKNodes project, offering improved functionality and compatibility with modern Blender versions, specifically Blender 4.2 and the 3.6 LTS release, while utilizing VTK version 9.2.6. Among its key features is the “VTK To Blender Mesh” node, which facilitates the conversion of VTK data structures into native Blender mesh objects, significantly streamlining workflows for scientific visualization and 3D data processing within Blender. The project also introduces a new update system to simplify maintenance and deployment, ensuring users can easily stay current with the latest improvements. Additionally, the repository includes modified core functionality that empowers developers and advanced users to create and integrate their own custom nodes, extending the toolset beyond its default capabilities. Overall, tkeskita/bvtknodes represents a robust and evolving solution for bridging VTK’s powerful data processing and visualization capabilities with Blender’s versatile 3D creation environment.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484224, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 245, "prompt_tokens": 297, "total_tokens": 542, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
