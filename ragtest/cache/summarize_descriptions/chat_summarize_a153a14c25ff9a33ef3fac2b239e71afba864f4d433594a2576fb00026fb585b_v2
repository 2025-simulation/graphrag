It functions as a filter within VTK-based visualization and data processing workflows, enabling users to isolate individual blocks—such as the commonly referenced `'internalMesh'`—from complex multi-block datasets, including those generated by simulation tools like OpenFOAM. Positioned typically after a Time Selector node in the pipeline, MULTI BLOCK LEAF acts as an intermediary component that facilitates focused processing on subsets of data by navigating the hierarchical organization of multi-block structures and retrieving terminal (leaf) blocks. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where downstream operations require access to specific patches or regions of interest within large, nested simulation outputs. The node supports customization through parameters such as `block` (to specify which block to extract) and `custom_code`, enhancing its flexibility in diverse visualization pipelines like those in Cubeflow or BVTKNodes. Overall, MULTI BLOCK LEAF streamlines the handling of multi-block data by providing precise, user-directed extraction of leaf datasets for subsequent analysis or rendering.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482385, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 239, "prompt_tokens": 883, "total_tokens": 1122, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
