Specifically, it takes two inputs: input 0, which is the source dataset containing the field data to be sampled, and input 1, which provides the point locations where sampling occurs. This enables the transfer of both spatial and field data—such as scalar, vector, or tensor attributes—from the source dataset to the target point set.\n\nThe filter supports various data types and configurations. It can sample unstructured grid data and map it onto a structured grid, such as vtkImageData, making it particularly useful for preparing data for volumetric formats like OpenVDB. Additionally, VTKPROBEFILTER offers user-configurable options, including the ability to pass specific data arrays through the filter and to set tolerance parameters that influence how closely a sample point must align with the source data for interpolation to occur. These settings are exposed as properties in pipeline implementations—for instance, in the Cubeflow pipeline, where the node is identified by the bl_idname VTKProbeFilterType and includes properties such as m_CategoricalData and m_ComputeTolerance.\n\nWithin a typical VTK processing pipeline, VTKPROBEFILTER may receive its inputs from sources such as a VTKImageData Object Source or filters like vtkAssignAttribute, and its output can feed into downstream algorithms such as vtkMarchingCubes for isosurface extraction. This makes VTKPROBEFILTER a versatile tool for data resampling, enabling interoperability between disparate datasets and facilitating visualization or analysis workflows that require data aligned to specific spatial configurations.\n\nIn summary, VTKPROBEFILTER serves as a critical interpolation and data mapping utility in VTK-based systems, combining geometric and attribute information from separate datasets into a unified output structured according to the target point locations, with configurable behavior to suit a range of scientific and engineering applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484225, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 388, "prompt_tokens": 365, "total_tokens": 753, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
