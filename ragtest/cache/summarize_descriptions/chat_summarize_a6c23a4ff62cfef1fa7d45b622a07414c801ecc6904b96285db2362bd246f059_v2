This module is specifically designed to host auto-generated or programmatically constructed node definitions for a wide variety of VTK reader types, consolidating their implementations into a shared, maintainable location within the software architecture.\n\nThe file contains the definitions and implementations of many specialized VTK reader classes, including but not limited to: vtkGaussianCubeReader, vtkGenericDataObjectReader, VTKTecplotTableReader, VTKTemporalDelimitedTextReader, VTKTreeReader, VTKTulipReader, VTKGraphReader, VTKH5PartReader, VTKH5RageReader, VTKHDFReader, VTKHDRReader, VTKFacetReader, VTKFixedWidthTextReader, VTKGAMBITReader, VTKGESignaReader, VTKGLTFReader, TIFF, TRUCHAS, Table, Tecplot, vtkOpenFOAMReader, vtkPChacoReader, vtkPDBReader, vtkPDataSetReader, vtkPExodusIIReader, DelimitedTextReader, EnSight readers, vtkPNMReader, vtkPOpenFOAMReader, VTKVolume16Reader, and VTKWindBladeReader. These readers support diverse data formats and scientific visualization use cases, ranging from computational fluid dynamics (e.g., OpenFOAM) to medical imaging (e.g., GESigna) and graph-based data structures (e.g., Tulip, Tree).\n\nThe module is not manually written in full but is instead generated automatically or programmatically, streamlining the integration of new or updated reader types into the system. This auto-generation approach ensures consistency, reduces boilerplate code, and facilitates scalability as the number of supported VTK readers grows. As a geo-like reference within the software’s digital architecture, GENERATED_NODES/GEN_VTKREADERS.PY functions as a critical hub for VTK reader node types, enabling modular, efficient, and extensible data ingestion capabilities across the application.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761482591, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 442, "prompt_tokens": 1088, "total_tokens": 1530, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
