It functions as an origin point in the pipeline, generating or supplying structured, voxel-based image or volumetric data formatted as VTK image data (vtkImageData). This node is identified in Cubeflow by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_ImageDataObjectSourceType` and may include custom code or extra parameters for tailored functionality. Its primary role is to provide structured 3D image data—commonly used for volume rendering or scientific visualization—as input for downstream processing nodes. Specifically, the data it emits can feed into filters such as `vtkProbeFilter`, enabling further analysis, interpolation, or transformation of the volumetric dataset. By delivering VTK-native image data into the visualization workflow, the VTKImageData Object Source serves as a critical bridge between raw or preprocessed volumetric information and subsequent visualization or computational stages within Blender’s node-based interface. This makes it especially valuable in applications requiring the integration of medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics outputs, or other grid-aligned 3D scalar or vector fields into a visual pipeline.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484208, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 236, "prompt_tokens": 285, "total_tokens": 521, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
