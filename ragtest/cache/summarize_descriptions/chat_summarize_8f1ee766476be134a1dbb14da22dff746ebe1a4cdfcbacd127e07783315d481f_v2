Identified by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_MultiBlockLeafType`, it functions as a filter within a VTK pipeline, typically positioned downstream of a Time Selector node. This node enables users to navigate and isolate specific components—often referred to as “leaf blocks”—from hierarchical, multi-block datasets commonly generated by simulation tools such as OpenFOAM. These leaf blocks represent the terminal or atomic datasets within the multi-block hierarchy, which can then be subjected to further analysis, processing, or visualization.\n\nThe MULTI BLOCK LEAF node is an integral part of data processing pipelines in environments like Cubeflow, where it supports the selective extraction of patches or subdomains from complex simulation outputs. It accepts multi-block datasets as input and uses user-defined parameters—such as a block index or identifier—to specify which leaf block to extract. Additional configuration options, including `custom_code` and `block` parameters, allow for flexible and programmable control over the extraction process. By isolating individual datasets from a larger multi-block structure, MULTI BLOCK LEAF facilitates focused downstream operations, such as rendering specific regions of interest, applying localized filters, or exporting subsets of simulation data. Its consistent role across descriptions underscores its purpose as a specialized selector within VTK pipelines, bridging high-level multi-block data organization with granular, block-level manipulation.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761484150, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 303, "prompt_tokens": 564, "total_tokens": 867, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
