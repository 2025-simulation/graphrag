It serves as a flexible component that integrates into the VTK data processing workflow, allowing for tailored data manipulation beyond the capabilities of standard VTK filters. Specifically, the CUSTOM FILTER receives its input from the Time Selector node and subsequently passes its processed output to downstream VTK filters, namely vtkAssignAttribute and vtkThreshold. This positioning within the pipeline highlights its role in intermediate data transformation, where user-specific operations—such as data conditioning, attribute computation, or selective filtering—are executed before further attribute assignment or threshold-based visualization steps. By supporting custom logic, the CUSTOM FILTER empowers users to extend the functionality of the VTK pipeline to meet specialized analytical or visualization requirements, maintaining compatibility with standard VTK data structures and processing conventions.\",5\n1,TIME SELECTOR,\"The TIME SELECTOR is a processing node used in VTK-based data pipelines, particularly within environments that integrate VTK and Blender, such as the Cubeflow pipeline. Identified by the `bl_idname` `BVTK_Node_TimeSelectorType`, it functions as a filtering node designed to select specific time steps from time-varying simulation data. This node typically receives input from a `vtkOpenFOAMReader`, which provides time-series simulation output, and passes the selected time step(s) downstream—often to a Custom Filter or other processing modules.\n\nThe TIME SELECTOR supports configuration through a `time_index` parameter, which allows users to specify which time step to extract from the input dataset. Examples in the data indicate that this parameter can be set to specific integer values, such as 1 or 5, depending on the desired time step. In addition to `time_index`, the node may include other parameters like `custom_code`, offering extended control over its behavior within the pipeline.\n\nAs a core component in simulation post-processing workflows, the TIME SELECTOR enables users to isolate particular moments in time from dynamic datasets, facilitating focused analysis or visualization of simulation results at those instants. Its role is consistent across descriptions: it does not modify the data itself but acts as a temporal filter, extracting subsets of time-varying data based on user-defined criteria. The node is explicitly designed for compatibility with VTK data structures and is commonly employed in scientific visualization pipelines that handle computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or other time-dependent simulations, especially those originating from OpenFOAM.\n\nAll descriptions align in portraying the TIME SELECTOR as a specialized, configurable node for time-step selection, with no substantive contradictions—only variations in phrasing and contextual detail. Its integration into VTK/Blender pipelines underscores its utility in bridging simulation data with interactive or automated visualization workflows.\",3\n34,VTKTHRESHOLD,\"VTKThreshold (also referred to as vtkThreshold or VTKTHRESHOLD) is a filtering node used within the BVTKNodes system for performing thresholding operations in Visualization Toolkit (VTK)-based data processing pipelines. It functions by extracting specific portions of a dataset based on user-defined attribute value thresholds, typically specified using parameters such as Value1 and Value2. This node operates as a VTK filter, selectively passing through only those elements of the input dataset whose associated attribute values fall within the defined threshold range.\n\nWithin the BVTKNodes architecture, VTKThreshold is implemented as a software class and is located in the file 'custom_nodes/VTKFilters.py'. It is designed to integrate seamlessly into custom VTK pipeline workflows, where it commonly receives input from a Custom Filter node and subsequently feeds its processed output into downstream nodes such as vtkBoxClipDataSet. This positioning underscores its role as an intermediary filtering step that refines datasets before further geometric or topological operations are applied.\n\nThe primary purpose of VTKThreshold is to enable users to isolate regions of interest within complex datasets—such as simulation results or scientific visualizations—by filtering based on scalar, vector, or other attribute data. Its implementation adheres to standard VTK conventions while being adapted for use in the BVTKNodes environment, which facilitates node-based visual programming with VTK components in platforms like Blender. By allowing precise control over data inclusion through threshold parameters, VTKThreshold enhances the flexibility and analytical power of VTK-based visualization pipelines.\",6\n0,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,\"VTKOpenFOAMReader (also referenced as vtkOpenFOAMReader or vtkOpenFoamReader) is a specialized VTK-based software component or data reader node designed to load OpenFOAM simulation data into a VTK-compatible visualization or processing pipeline. It functions as a source node, typically serving as the initial entry point for simulation data in workflows such as those implemented in Cubeflow or Blender-integrated VTK environments. The node is defined in the file `generated_nodes/gen_VTKReaders.py` and carries the `bl_idname` identifier `VTKOpenFOAMReaderType`.\n\nThis reader is specifically tailored to handle OpenFOAM case files—commonly referenced with paths like `$/cubeflow/case.foam`—and supports a wide range of configurable properties that control how data is imported and processed. Key configuration options include file path specification, time step selection or handling, data format settings, mesh caching behavior, and precision settings such as the use of 64-bit floating-point numbers. It also provides functionality for managing data arrays, including the ability to enable all patch arrays via custom code methods like `EnableAllPatchArrays()`, and supports operations such as cell-to-point data conversion.\n\nVTKOpenFOAMReader integrates seamlessly into VTK-based data processing pipelines, where it reads native OpenFOAM simulation output and converts it into VTK data structures suitable for visualization, analysis, or further computation. Its design emphasizes flexibility and performance, allowing users to fine-tune data loading behavior based on the requirements of their specific simulation or visualization task. The component is frequently used in advanced workflows, including boundary surface extraction, and is documented as a representative example of how custom code can be incorporated into VTK reader nodes.\n\nIn summary, VTKOpenFOAMReader is a versatile and configurable reader node that bridges OpenFOAM simulation data with the VTK visualization ecosystem, offering robust support for time-varying datasets, mesh handling, and data array management within a modular pipeline architecture.\",5\n54,CUBEFLOW_BOUNDARY_PATCH,An example node tree configuration designed to extract a single boundary patch from an OpenFOAM case,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n39,CUSTOM FILTER,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,\"The CUSTOM FILTER is a data processing component whose output is specifically designed to be consumed by VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE. After the CUSTOM FILTER generates its output dataset, this data is passed directly to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, which is responsible for assigning specific attributes to the data. This pipeline arrangement ensures that the data produced by the CUSTOM FILTER undergoes subsequent attribute assignment as part of a structured visualization or analysis workflow. Multiple descriptions consistently indicate that the CUSTOM FILTER does not perform attribute assignment itself; instead, it relies on VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE to handle this task. Thus, the relationship between the two entities is sequential and complementary: the CUSTOM FILTER serves as a data source or transformation step, and VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE acts on that output to define or modify data attributes such as scalars, vectors, tensors, or other field data characteristics. This design aligns with typical Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline conventions, where filters produce data and attribute assignment modules refine metadata for downstream rendering or computation.\",13\n1,TIME SELECTOR,MULTI BLOCK LEAF,\"The TIME SELECTOR and MULTI BLOCK LEAF are components in a hierarchical data processing pipeline, working in tandem to extract specific subsets of time-varying, multi-block datasets. The TIME SELECTOR functions as a filtering mechanism that selects or filters data based on specific time steps or temporal criteria. It outputs this time-filtered or time-step-selected data to the MULTI BLOCK LEAF node. The primary role of the MULTI BLOCK LEAF is to process the incoming time-filtered multi-block data and extract individual blocks or leaf-level datasets from the hierarchical structure. This extraction may involve isolating specific blocks, selecting leaf nodes within the multi-block hierarchy, or retrieving datasets associated with those leaf-level components. \n\nIn essence, the TIME SELECTOR ensures that only data from relevant time steps is passed forward, while the MULTI BLOCK LEAF handles the spatial or structural decomposition of that temporally filtered data to isolate the desired block or leaf dataset. This coordinated workflow enables efficient and targeted access to subsets of complex, time-dependent multi-block data structures—commonly found in scientific simulations or large-scale data analysis—by first narrowing the temporal scope and then drilling down into the structural hierarchy to retrieve specific components. The consistent terminology across descriptions—such as “time-filtered data,” “selected time-step data,” “block extraction,” and “leaf dataset extraction”—confirms a unified operational model where temporal selection precedes structural decomposition, with the TIME SELECTOR always acting as the upstream provider and the MULTI BLOCK LEAF as the downstream extractor.\",11\n42,VTKTHRESHOLD,VTKBOXCLIPDATASET,vtkThreshold outputs filtered data to vtkBoxClipDataSet for spatial clipping,9\n0,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,TIME SELECTOR,\"The vtkOpenFOAMReader is a data reader component that extracts time-varying simulation data from OpenFOAM simulation outputs. This data is specifically structured to support temporal analysis and visualization workflows. The primary role of the vtkOpenFOAMReader is to serve as the initial data source in a processing pipeline, where it outputs simulation data that is directly fed into the Time Selector node. The Time Selector acts as the first subsequent processing step, receiving this input to enable users to select, filter, or isolate specific time steps from the time-varying dataset. This functionality is essential for analyzing transient simulations, as it allows users to focus on particular moments in the simulation timeline without loading or processing unnecessary data. Across all descriptions, there is consistent agreement that the vtkOpenFOAMReader provides input to the Time Selector exclusively for the purpose of time-step selection or filtering, and that this connection represents the first stage in the data processing pipeline. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions; rather, they collectively reinforce a coherent workflow in which the vtkOpenFOAMReader and Time Selector operate in sequence to manage and refine time-dependent simulation data for downstream visualization or analysis tasks.\",8\n56,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,CUBEFLOW_BOUNDARY_PATCH,The cubeflow_boundary_patch example uses vtkOpenFOAMReader with custom code to enable patch array extraction,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
