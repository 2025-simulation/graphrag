It operates by tracing paths—known as streamlines—through a vector field using specified seed points or seed sources, which can include structured grids or plane sources as input. The component is implemented as a VTK algorithm and is accessible as a node in visualization pipelines, particularly within environments that utilize generated VTK node wrappers, such as those defined in the module generated_nodes/gen_VTKFilters2.py, where it is identified by the bl_idname VTKStreamTracerType.\n\nVTKStreamTracer offers a range of configurable parameters that allow users to control the streamline computation process in detail. These include integration step size, propagation limits (such as maximum integration time or distance), and options for advanced computations like vorticity. These settings enable precise control over the accuracy and extent of the resulting streamlines, making the filter suitable for a variety of applications in computational fluid dynamics, meteorology, and other fields that rely on vector field analysis.\n\nAs a core VTK filter, VTKStreamTracer integrates seamlessly into VTK-based visualization systems and is commonly used to visualize the direction and behavior of flow within vector datasets. Its functionality is consistent across descriptions: it takes vector field data as input, uses seed geometry to initiate streamline tracing, and outputs streamline geometry that represents the integrated paths through the field. There are no contradictions among the provided descriptions; rather, they collectively emphasize its role as a configurable, algorithmic filter within the VTK framework for streamline generation.\",6\n84,CUBEFLOW_STREAM_TRACERS,cubeflow_stream_tracers is the name of a VTK-based visualization node tree example used to compute and render streamlines in vector fields,4\n81,VTKPLANESOURCE,\"VTKPlaneSource is a VTK-based source object used to generate a planar polygonal surface, commonly employed as a seed source for streamline integration in flow visualization workflows—particularly as an input to vtkStreamTracer. Implemented as a VTK node with the identifier bl_idname VTKPlaneSourceType, it is defined in the file generated_nodes/gen_VTKSources.py and functions as a geometric source within VTK pipelines. The planar surface it produces is fully customizable through several key parameters: it can be defined by an origin (or center), two points (point1 and point2) that establish the plane’s orientation and extent, or alternatively by a center, a normal vector, and resolution settings. Specifically, the node exposes properties such as m_XResolution and m_YResolution, which control the discretization of the plane along its two principal axes, thereby determining the density of the generated mesh. This results in a structured grid of points arranged in a rectangular or square layout, forming a polygonal mesh suitable for seeding particle paths in vector field visualization. The generated planar grid serves as a foundational element in computational fluid dynamics and scientific visualization, where streamlines are traced from these seed points to illustrate flow behavior. Across all descriptions, VTKPlaneSource is consistently characterized as a versatile and essential VTK source object for creating planar geometries tailored for use in streamline-based analysis.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n114,VTKSTREAMTRACER,CUBEFLOW_STREAM_TRACERS,The cubeflow_stream_tracers example uses vtkStreamTracer to compute streamlines,10\n121,VTKPLANESOURCE,CUBEFLOW_STREAM_TRACERS,The cubeflow_stream_tracers example uses vtkPlaneSource to generate seed points for tracing,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
