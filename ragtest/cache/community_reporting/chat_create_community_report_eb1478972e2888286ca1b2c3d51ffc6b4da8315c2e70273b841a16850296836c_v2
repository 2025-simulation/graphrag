Within the context of Blender—a popular 3D creation suite—VTK is integrated via the BVTKNodes add-on, which enables users to leverage VTK’s powerful capabilities directly inside Blender through a node-based interface. This integration allows for the creation of custom visualization pipelines using VTK data types such as vtkImageData and vector or scalar arrays as inputs, and facilitates the conversion of VTK output into Blender-native geometry through nodes like “VTK To Blender Mesh.”\n\nBVTKNodes interfaces with VTK to expose its classes, filters, and documentation, enabling users to construct complex data processing and rendering workflows within Blender’s visual programming environment. The referenced VTK versions span from 7.0 onward, with specific mentions of versions 8.2.0, 9.0.1, 9.1.0, 9.2.2, and 9.2.6, indicating ongoing compatibility and evolution of the integration across multiple VTK releases.
