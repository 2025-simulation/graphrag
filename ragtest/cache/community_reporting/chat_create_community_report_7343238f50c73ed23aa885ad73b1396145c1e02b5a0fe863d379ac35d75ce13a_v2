This filter operates on datasets—often mesh-based—and allows users to designate a particular data array (e.g., an array named 'U') as the active attribute for downstream operations, such as glyph orientation. It is commonly employed to ensure that visualization modules correctly interpret which array should be treated as a vector field, scalar field, or other attribute type.\n\nThe node is configurable via properties such as the object name, enabling users to specify which input array should be reassigned or promoted. It can both assign new attributes and rename or reclassify existing ones within dataset arrays. VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE receives input from various upstream sources, including Custom Filter nodes or Multi Block Leaf data structures, and typically feeds its output into subsequent processing nodes like vtkProbeFilter. \n\nFunctionally, VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE plays a critical role in preparing data for visualization by explicitly defining how arrays should be interpreted within the VTK pipeline. Its bl_idname is identified as VTKAssignAttributeType, aligning it with Blender’s VTK integration framework where applicable. Overall, it serves as a versatile and essential component for managing data attribute semantics in scientific visualization workflows built on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).\",8\n38,VTKPROBEFILTER,\"VTKPROBEFILTER is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter node designed to sample or interpolate data from one dataset onto the points of another dataset. Specifically, it takes two inputs: input 0, which is the source dataset containing the field data to be sampled, and input 1, which provides the point locations where sampling occurs. This enables the transfer of both spatial and field data—such as scalar, vector, or tensor attributes—from the source dataset to the target point set.\n\nThe filter supports various data types and configurations. It can sample unstructured grid data and map it onto a structured grid, such as vtkImageData, making it particularly useful for preparing data for volumetric formats like OpenVDB. Additionally, VTKPROBEFILTER offers user-configurable options, including the ability to pass specific data arrays through the filter and to set tolerance parameters that influence how closely a sample point must align with the source data for interpolation to occur. These settings are exposed as properties in pipeline implementations—for instance, in the Cubeflow pipeline, where the node is identified by the bl_idname VTKProbeFilterType and includes properties such as m_CategoricalData and m_ComputeTolerance.\n\nWithin a typical VTK processing pipeline, VTKPROBEFILTER may receive its inputs from sources such as a VTKImageData Object Source or filters like vtkAssignAttribute, and its output can feed into downstream algorithms such as vtkMarchingCubes for isosurface extraction. This makes VTKPROBEFILTER a versatile tool for data resampling, enabling interoperability between disparate datasets and facilitating visualization or analysis workflows that require data aligned to specific spatial configurations.\n\nIn summary, VTKPROBEFILTER serves as a critical interpolation and data mapping utility in VTK-based systems, combining geometric and attribute information from separate datasets into a unified output structured according to the target point locations, with configurable behavior to suit a range of scientific and engineering applications.\",7\n61,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,\"The VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER is a specialized node within the Cubeflow pipeline designed to convert VTK (Visualization Toolkit) volume or image data into the OpenVDB (.vdb) format. This conversion enables the resulting volumetric data to be utilized in downstream applications such as advanced volumetric rendering or simulation workflows, particularly within Blender. Functioning as a sink node in the pipeline, it does not pass data further downstream but instead finalizes the processing chain by exporting the converted data to a file. The node is implemented with the Blender-specific identifier bl_idname BVTK_Node_VTKToOpenVDBExporterType and includes support for custom code through an extra parameter, allowing users to tailor its behavior to specific needs. By bridging the VTK and OpenVDB ecosystems, this exporter facilitates interoperability between scientific visualization tools that produce VTK data and creative or simulation software—like Blender—that leverage OpenVDB for efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data. Its primary role is to ensure that volumetric datasets originally represented in VTK format can be accurately and efficiently transformed into the industry-standard OpenVDB format, preserving data fidelity while enabling high-quality rendering and simulation capabilities.\",6\n37,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,\"The VTKImageData Object Source is a specialized data source node used within VTK-based visualization pipelines, particularly integrated into the Cubeflow environment for Blender. It functions as an origin point in the pipeline, generating or supplying structured, voxel-based image or volumetric data formatted as VTK image data (vtkImageData). This node is identified in Cubeflow by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_ImageDataObjectSourceType` and may include custom code or extra parameters for tailored functionality. Its primary role is to provide structured 3D image data—commonly used for volume rendering or scientific visualization—as input for downstream processing nodes. Specifically, the data it emits can feed into filters such as `vtkProbeFilter`, enabling further analysis, interpolation, or transformation of the volumetric dataset. By delivering VTK-native image data into the visualization workflow, the VTKImageData Object Source serves as a critical bridge between raw or preprocessed volumetric information and subsequent visualization or computational stages within Blender’s node-based interface. This makes it especially valuable in applications requiring the integration of medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics outputs, or other grid-aligned 3D scalar or vector fields into a visual pipeline.\",3\n25,VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER,\"vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter designed to extract surface geometry from volumetric datasets based on region or material identifiers. It operates on input data that may include clipped or segmented volumetric representations, and it specifically isolates surface representations corresponding to boundaries between different regions or materials within the dataset. This functionality makes it particularly useful in scientific visualization workflows, especially for rendering simulation domains where distinct regions—such as different tissue types in medical imaging or material phases in engineering simulations—need to be clearly delineated. By processing the input dataset and identifying transitions between regions, vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter generates surface meshes that accurately reflect these internal boundaries, enabling clearer and more informative visual analysis. The filter is implemented as a VTK module and functions as a node within VTK’s pipeline architecture, allowing it to be integrated into larger data processing and visualization systems. Overall, vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter serves as a key tool for converting complex, multi-region volumetric data into surface-based representations suitable for rendering and further geometric analysis.\",2\n63,CUBEFLOW_OPENVDB_EXPORT,cubeflow_openvdb_export is the name of an example node tree used to demonstrate OpenVDB export and volumetric rendering in Blender using VTK data,2\n62,VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME,\"VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME is a specialized node designed to bridge the gap between VTK (Visualization Toolkit) volumetric data and Blender’s native volume rendering system. This node functions by directly converting VTK image data—commonly used in scientific visualization and medical imaging—into a format that is fully compatible with Blender’s volume object structure. Introduced in Blender version 3.6 and available in subsequent releases, the VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME node enables users to seamlessly import and render volumetric datasets within Blender’s 3D environment without requiring intermediate conversion steps or external tools. By doing so, it facilitates the integration of high-fidelity scientific or medical volume data into Blender’s powerful rendering and animation pipeline, making it particularly useful for researchers, visual effects artists, and educators who work with complex 3D scalar fields or tomographic data. The node preserves the spatial and intensity information inherent in VTK-formatted volumes, ensuring accurate representation when rendered using Blender’s volume shaders and lighting systems.\",4\n24,VTKCLIPDATASET,\"vtkClipDataSet is a filter within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) used to clip or slice datasets based on user-specified criteria. It operates by extracting a portion of the input geometry using either an implicit plane, a general implicit function, or a scalar value threshold as the clipping criterion. This filter is commonly employed in scientific visualization and data processing workflows to isolate regions of interest within structured or unstructured datasets. As a VTK-based data processing node, vtkClipDataSet receives input from upstream sources—such as vtkAssignAttribute—and produces a modified output that retains only the portion of the dataset satisfying the defined clipping condition. The flexibility of its clipping mechanism allows users to define complex clipping boundaries beyond simple planar cuts, making it a versatile tool for manipulating volumetric and geometric data. Whether used in medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics, or other simulation-based fields, vtkClipDataSet serves as a fundamental component for dataset interrogation and visualization refinement within the VTK pipeline architecture.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,VTKCONTOURFILTER,\"In the VTK (Visualization Toolkit) pipeline, vtkAssignAttribute and vtkContourFilter work in sequence to facilitate contour generation from input datasets. Specifically, vtkAssignAttribute serves as a preprocessing filter that modifies or assigns attribute data—such as scalars, vectors, or tensors—within a dataset, ensuring that the appropriate data arrays are designated for downstream processing. The output of vtkAssignAttribute, which includes this processed and properly configured attribute data, is then passed directly as input to vtkContourFilter. vtkContourFilter utilizes this prepared data to generate isosurfaces or isolines (contours) based on specified scalar values. Thus, vtkAssignAttribute plays a critical role in preparing the dataset so that vtkContourFilter can correctly interpret and operate on the relevant scalar field for contour extraction. This coordinated interaction ensures that the visualization pipeline accurately reflects the intended data attributes during contour generation.\",14\n84,VTKPROBEFILTER,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,The vtkProbeFilter output is sent to the VTK to OpenVDB Exporter for format conversion,13\n47,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,VTKPROBEFILTER,\"The VTKImageData Object Source and vtkProbeFilter are components within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework that interact in a data processing pipeline, though their exact relationship requires clarification to resolve apparent contradictions in the provided descriptions.  \n\nThe majority of the descriptions consistently state that the VTKImageData Object Source serves as the source of input data—specifically as “input 0”—for the vtkProbeFilter. In this role, the VTKImageData Object Source provides structured volumetric data (in the form of vtkImageData) that the vtkProbeFilter uses as a sampling grid. The vtkProbeFilter then probes or samples another dataset (typically an unstructured grid or other geometry) at the points defined by this vtkImageData grid, interpolating values from the source dataset onto the structured grid.\n\nHowever, one description claims the opposite: that the vtkProbeFilter converts unstructured grid data into vtkImageData, which is then provided via the VTKImageData Object Source. This appears contradictory because it reverses the data flow, suggesting the VTKImageData Object Source is an output rather than an input. Upon closer inspection, this likely reflects a misunderstanding of VTK pipeline semantics. In standard VTK usage, the vtkProbeFilter requires two inputs:  \n- Input 0 (the source): a dataset to be sampled (often an unstructured grid), and  \n- Input 1 (the probe): a vtkImageData object that defines where sampling occurs.  \n\nThus, the VTKImageData Object Source typically supplies Input 1 (the probe structure), not Input 0. However, the provided descriptions uniformly refer to it as “input 0,” which may stem from a specific pipeline configuration or mislabeling. Regardless, the functional role remains that the VTKImageData Object Source provides the spatial grid used for probing. The vtkProbeFilter does not generate the VTKImageData Object Source; rather, it produces a new vtkImageData output that contains sampled values from the source dataset, interpolated onto the probe grid.\n\nIn summary, the VTKImageData Object Source supplies structured grid data that defines the sampling locations for the vtkProbeFilter. The vtkProbeFilter uses this grid to sample values from another dataset (e.g., an unstructured grid) and outputs a new vtkImageData object containing the interpolated results. While one description inaccurately suggests the VTKImageData Object Source receives data from the vtkProbeFilter, the consistent and technically accurate interpretation is that it acts as an input—specifically the probe grid—to the vtkProbeFilter.\",10\n28,VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER,VTKPOLYDATANORMALS,The surface filter outputs polygonal surface data to vtkPolyDataNormals for normal computation,9\n68,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,VTKImageData Object Source supplies the structured data required by VTK To OpenVDB Exporter for .vdb conversion,9\n70,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,CUBEFLOW_OPENVDB_EXPORT,The cubeflow_openvdb_export node tree includes and demonstrates the use of VTK To OpenVDB Exporter,8\n71,VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,VTKImageData Object Source provides voxel data directly to VTK To Blender Volume for volumetric rendering in Blender 3.6+,7\n27,VTKCLIPDATASET,VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER,\"VTKCLIPDATASET and VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER are two components in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline that work in sequence to process and extract surface representations from volumetric data. Specifically, VTKCLIPDATASET is responsible for clipping a given vtkDataSet—typically a volumetric dataset—using an implicit function (such as a plane) or a scalar value, thereby producing a subset of the original data that lies on one side of the clipping criterion. The output of VTKCLIPDATASET is a clipped volumetric dataset that retains the internal structure of the original data but is bounded by the newly created clipping surface.\n\nThis clipped volumetric data is then passed to VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER, which performs surface extraction. The primary role of VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER is to generate boundary surfaces from the volumetric regions provided by the preceding filter. In this context, it takes the clipped dataset output by VTKCLIPDATASET and extracts the external or internal surfaces that define the boundaries of the remaining volumetric region. This enables visualization of the cut surfaces created by the clipping operation, which is especially useful in applications such as medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics, or any domain requiring cross-sectional analysis of 3D datasets.\n\nTogether, VTKCLIPDATASET and VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER form a processing chain where the former prepares a reduced or sectioned version of the original dataset, and the latter converts that sectioned volume into a surface mesh suitable for rendering or further geometric analysis. This workflow ensures that users can not only isolate regions of interest within a volume but also visualize the resulting interfaces with high fidelity. The integration of these two filters exemplifies VTK’s modular design, allowing complex visualization tasks to be constructed by linking specialized components in a pipeline.\",4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
