It encapsulates the geometric properties of a sphere, specifically its radius and center, enabling users to define and manipulate spherical objects programmatically. In addition to serving as a geometric primitive, VTKSPHERE also functions as an implicit function, which means it can be used to evaluate whether a given point in 3D space lies inside, outside, or on the surface of the sphere based on its signed distance from the sphere's boundary. This dual role aligns with VTK’s broader architecture, where implicit functions are commonly employed for tasks such as clipping, contouring, and collision detection.
