This filter supports high customization, including user-defined source geometry and scaling behavior, making it indispensable in scientific visualization for representing flow direction, force vectors, or other spatial phenomena.

Its primary purpose is to reduce the number of points—often to decrease glyph density or overall data density—for improved visualization performance and clarity. VTKMaskPoints operates by applying user-defined criteria to select a subset of the original points. These criteria can include specifying a maximum point count, setting a sampling ratio, or performing random selection. By doing so, it enables users to manage large point datasets more efficiently without compromising the essential structure or features of the data. As a named node within a VTK pipeline, VTKMaskPoints integrates seamlessly with other VTK components and is commonly employed in scientific visualization workflows where rendering every point would be computationally expensive or visually overwhelming. The filter is particularly useful when generating glyphs, streamlines, or other point-based visual representations where excessive point density can obscure interpretation. In summary, VTKMaskPoints serves as a versatile and essential tool for point data reduction in VTK-based applications, offering flexible subsampling strategies to balance visual fidelity with computational efficiency.\",4\n18,VTKGLYPH3D,\"vtkGlyph3D is a filter in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) designed to place geometric glyphs—such as arrows or other user-defined graphical objects—at specified points in three-dimensional space. It is commonly employed to visualize vector fields, directional data, or other point-based attributes by mapping data values to the orientation, scale, and type of glyph rendered. The filter accepts input point data and, optionally, associated vector or scalar information that dictates how each glyph is transformed. For instance, vector data can determine the direction in which an arrow glyph points, while scalar values may control its size or color. vtkGlyph3D supports a high degree of customization, allowing users to define the source geometry for the glyph (e.g., a cone, sphere, or custom mesh), specify scaling behavior (including uniform or non-uniform scaling), and choose whether glyph orientation follows input vectors. This capability makes it particularly valuable in scientific visualization applications where representing flow direction, force vectors, or other spatially varying vector quantities is essential. By combining geometric representation with data-driven transformation, vtkGlyph3D provides an intuitive and powerful means of conveying complex multidimensional data in a visually interpretable format.\",6\n123,COLOR MAPPER.001,Color Mapper.001 is a second instance of a color mapping component that applies color to the output of vtkGlyph3D based on scalar data,1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n20,VTKMASKPOINTS,VTKGLYPH3D,\"VTKMaskPoints and VTKGlyph3D are two interconnected components commonly used in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline for scientific visualization. VTKMaskPoints serves as a preprocessing filter that takes a dense point dataset and outputs a reduced or subsampled set of points. This reduction is typically employed to manage computational load or improve visual clarity when dealing with large datasets. The resulting subset of points from VTKMaskPoints is specifically designed to retain key spatial characteristics of the original data while decreasing the total number of points.\n\nThis reduced point set generated by VTKMaskPoints is then passed as input—specifically as input 0—to VTKGlyph3D. In the VTK pipeline, VTKGlyph3D uses this input to determine the positions at which glyphs (such as arrows, cones, spheres, or other geometric markers) will be placed. The glyphs themselves are usually defined by a separate source object (e.g., a vector field or another geometric primitive), and their orientation, scale, and type can be controlled by associated point data such as vectors or scalars. By receiving the subsampled point positions from VTKMaskPoints, VTKGlyph3D ensures that glyphs are rendered only at selected locations, avoiding visual clutter and improving performance.\n\nIn summary, VTKMaskPoints acts as a strategic filter that supplies a manageable and representative subset of point data to VTKGlyph3D, which in turn uses these points as placement locations for visual glyphs. This workflow is especially useful in applications like vector field visualization, where rendering a glyph at every original data point would be computationally expensive and visually overwhelming. The integration of VTKMaskPoints and VTKGlyph3D thus enables efficient, scalable, and interpretable visual representations of complex datasets.\",10\n22,VTKGLYPH3D,VTKARROWSOURCE,\"VTKArrowSource and VTKGlyph3D are two interconnected components within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework, commonly used for scientific visualization. VTKArrowSource is a data source object that generates a polygonal representation of an arrow, which serves as a geometric primitive. This arrow geometry is specifically designed to be used as a glyph—a repeated graphical symbol—by VTKGlyph3D. VTKGlyph3D is a filter that places a copy of a specified geometric object (the glyph) at each point in an input dataset, often to visualize vector fields by orienting and scaling the glyphs according to vector data. In this workflow, VTKArrowSource provides the arrow-shaped geometry as input 1 to VTKGlyph3D, effectively defining the visual form of the glyphs that will be replicated and transformed across the dataset. Thus, VTKArrowSource acts as the glyph geometry provider, and VTKGlyph3D uses this geometry to produce the final glyph-based visualization. The relationship is consistent across all descriptions: VTKArrowSource supplies the arrow geometry that VTKGlyph3D employs as its glyph shape, enabling intuitive representation of directional data such as velocity or force vectors.\",9\n206,VTKGLYPH3D,COLOR MAPPER.001,vtkGlyph3D’s output is sent to Color Mapper.001 for color mapping,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
