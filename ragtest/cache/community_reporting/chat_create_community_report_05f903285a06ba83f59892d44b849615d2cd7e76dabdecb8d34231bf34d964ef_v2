It functions as a structured image data supplier, generating or providing vtkImageData—VTK’s native representation for regular, rectilinear 3D image or volume datasets composed of voxels. This node is specifically designed to serve as an input source for downstream operations, including probing, filtering, and volumetric rendering.\n\nWithin the Cubeflow pipeline, the VTKImageData Object Source is implemented as a custom node with the identifier bl_idname BVTK_Node_ImageDataObjectSourceType and supports additional user-defined parameters through custom code. Its primary role is to produce structured 3D image data with defined dimensions, origin, and spacing, ensuring compatibility with other VTK-based processing nodes. The generated data typically represents scalar or vector fields sampled on a regular grid, making it suitable for applications such as medical imaging, scientific visualization, and computational simulation.\n\nA key use case for this node involves feeding structured volumetric data into vtkProbeFilter or similar components that require sampling of field values at specific points. To ensure accurate probing, the sampling points must align with voxel centers, emphasizing the importance of precise spatial configuration in the data it supplies. As a source node, it does not depend on upstream data inputs but instead originates the dataset within the pipeline, enabling the construction of complex visualization workflows from synthesized or preloaded image data.\n\nIn summary, the VTKImageData Object Source is a foundational component in VTK-integrated systems, providing structured, voxel-based 3D image data to support a range of visualization and analysis tasks within modular, node-based environments like Cubeflow in Blender.\",4\n52,VTKPROBEFILTER,\"VTKProbeFilter is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter designed to sample and interpolate data from one dataset—referred to as the source or input 0—onto the points of another dataset, known as the probe or input 1. This filter plays a key role in scientific visualization pipelines by enabling the transfer of field values (such as scalars, vectors, or tensors) from complex or unstructured data onto a more regular or user-defined point distribution. Commonly, the source dataset may be an unstructured grid, while the probe dataset is often a structured grid such as vtkImageData, which facilitates compatibility with volumetric data formats like OpenVDB.\n\nThe VTKProbeFilter operates by interpolating values at each point in the probe dataset based on the spatial proximity and values in the source dataset. It supports configurable tolerance settings (e.g., through the m_ComputeTolerance property), which influence how closely a probe point must align with the source data to yield a valid sample. Additionally, the filter includes options to pass through or preserve specific data arrays from either input, enhancing its flexibility in complex processing workflows.\n\nWithin specific visualization frameworks—such as the Cubeflow pipeline—the VTKProbeFilter is implemented as a processing node with the identifier bl_idname VTKProbeFilterType. It exposes properties like m_CategoricalData, indicating support for handling non-numeric or discrete data types alongside continuous fields. The filter commonly receives input from sources such as VTKImageData Object Source and vtkAssignAttribute nodes and can feed its output into downstream filters like vtkMarchingCubes for isosurface extraction.\n\nOverall, VTKProbeFilter serves as a versatile interpolation and data-sampling tool in VTK-based applications, bridging disparate data representations and enabling downstream analysis or rendering of resampled datasets. Its ability to map data from unstructured to structured grids makes it particularly valuable in workflows requiring volumetric representation, simulation data analysis, or multi-dataset alignment.\",8\n85,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,\"The VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER is a specialized node within the Cubeflow pipeline designed to convert and export VTK (Visualization Toolkit) volume or image data into the OpenVDB (.vdb) file format, which is widely used for volumetric rendering in Blender. Functioning as a sink node—meaning it typically resides at the end of a node-based workflow—it accepts VTK data as input and processes it for output in the OpenVDB format, enabling seamless integration into visual effects and simulation pipelines that rely on high-resolution volumetric data.\n\nThis exporter node is identified in Blender’s internal system with the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_VTKToOpenVDBExporterType` and includes support for custom code via an extra parameter, allowing users to tailor its behavior to specific workflow requirements. The conversion process may involve an intermediate step where the VTK data is first serialized into a JSON file before being transformed into the final OpenVDB format. This intermediate representation facilitates data integrity and simplifies debugging or inspection during the export process.\n\nPrimarily used in volumetric rendering workflows, the VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER bridges scientific or simulation-based VTK datasets—commonly generated in computational fluid dynamics, medical imaging, or other scientific visualization domains—with the artistic and production-oriented capabilities of Blender’s volumetric rendering engine. By converting structured or unstructured VTK grids into OpenVDB’s sparse, hierarchical voxel format, the node ensures efficient memory usage and performance during rendering while preserving the essential volumetric characteristics of the original data.\n\nOverall, the VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER serves as a critical utility for users working at the intersection of scientific data and 3D content creation, providing a reliable, customizable, and pipeline-integrated method to bring VTK-based volumetric information into Blender’s ecosystem via the industry-standard OpenVDB format.\",7\n87,CUBEFLOW_OPENVDB_EXPORT,\"cubeflow_openvdb_export is the name of an example node tree used to demonstrate OpenVDB export and volumetric rendering in Blender using VTK data\nAn example node tree demonstrating the conversion of VTK unstructured grid data into OpenVDB format and subsequent volumetric rendering in Blender\",2\n86,VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME,\"VTK To Blender Volume is a node introduced in Blender 3.6 that facilitates the direct conversion of VTK (Visualization Toolkit) image data into a Blender-native volumetric object. This node streamlines the workflow for users working with scientific or medical imaging data by enabling them to import VTK volume data directly into Blender without the need for intermediate file conversions—specifically bypassing the use of JSON or OpenVDB export formats. By doing so, it preserves data integrity and simplifies the process of visualizing volumetric datasets within Blender’s 3D environment. The node is designed to be used within Blender’s geometry nodes system, allowing artists and researchers to seamlessly integrate VTK-based volumetric information into their scenes as fully functional volume objects compatible with Blender’s rendering and simulation tools. This functionality enhances Blender’s capabilities in scientific visualization and expands its utility for applications requiring accurate representation of 3D scalar fields, such as in computational fluid dynamics, medical imaging, or geospatial analysis.\",4\n162,VTKIMAGEDATA,\"vtkImageData is a 3D data structure from the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) that stores scalar or vector fields such as density, color, flame, and temperature for export to OpenVDB\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n79,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,VTKPROBEFILTER,\"The VTKImageData Object Source and vtkProbeFilter are components in a Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline that work together to facilitate spatial data probing and conversion. The VTKImageData Object Source serves as the provider of structured volumetric data—specifically in the form of vtkImageData—and functions as “input 0” to the vtkProbeFilter. This input supplies the source dataset that the vtkProbeFilter samples or probes during its operation.  \n\nContrary to one of the descriptions suggesting that the vtkProbeFilter converts unstructured grid data into vtkImageData—which is then provided by the VTKImageData Object Source—the accurate and consistent interpretation across the majority of the descriptions is that the VTKImageData Object Source supplies the structured grid (vtkImageData) that acts as the sampling domain for the vtkProbeFilter. In typical VTK usage, the vtkProbeFilter takes two inputs: a source dataset (often unstructured or point-based) and a structured grid (vtkImageData) that defines where interpolation or probing should occur. The filter then samples the source data at the points defined by the structured grid and outputs a new vtkImageData containing the interpolated values.  \n\nTherefore, the VTKImageData Object Source does not receive data from the vtkProbeFilter; rather, it provides the spatial template (input 0) that dictates where probing occurs. The vtkProbeFilter uses this template to sample another dataset (usually connected as input 1), producing an output that retains the structure of the VTKImageData input but with values derived from the probed dataset. This clarifies the apparent contradiction: the vtkProbeFilter does not generate the vtkImageData consumed by the VTKImageData Object Source; instead, the VTKImageData Object Source supplies the foundational grid that enables the probing operation.  \n\nIn summary, the VTKImageData Object Source is the origin of the structured grid used by vtkProbeFilter for spatial sampling, consistently connected as input 0. The vtkProbeFilter leverages this grid to interpolate values from another dataset (typically unstructured), producing a new vtkImageData output that combines the geometry of the source grid with data values sampled from the probed dataset. This pipeline arrangement is standard in VTK for resampling or visualizing unstructured data on a regular grid.\",12\n81,VTKPROBEFILTER,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,\"In the visualization pipeline, the VTKImageData Object Source serves as the data provider for vtkProbeFilter.
