Identified by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_MultiBlockLeafType`, it functions as a filter within a VTK pipeline, typically positioned downstream of a Time Selector node. This node enables users to navigate and isolate specific components—often referred to as “leaf blocks”—from hierarchical, multi-block datasets commonly generated by simulation tools such as OpenFOAM. These leaf blocks represent the terminal or atomic datasets within the multi-block hierarchy, which can then be subjected to further analysis, processing, or visualization.\n\nThe MULTI BLOCK LEAF node is an integral part of data processing pipelines in environments like Cubeflow, where it supports the selective extraction of patches or subdomains from complex simulation outputs. It accepts multi-block datasets as input and uses user-defined parameters—such as a block index or identifier—to specify which leaf block to extract. Additional configuration options, including `custom_code` and `block` parameters, allow for flexible and programmable control over the extraction process. By isolating individual datasets from a larger multi-block structure, MULTI BLOCK LEAF facilitates focused downstream operations, such as rendering specific regions of interest, applying localized filters, or exporting subsets of simulation data. Its consistent role across descriptions underscores its purpose as a specialized selector within VTK pipelines, bridging high-level multi-block data organization with granular, block-level manipulation.\",8\n19,VTKARROWSOURCE,\"VTKArrowSource is a source object within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework that generates a three-dimensional arrow geometry, commonly employed in scientific visualization workflows to represent directional data such as vectors. It functions as a node in VTK-based data processing pipelines, producing polygonal arrow geometry that serves as a glyph—particularly when used in conjunction with the vtkGlyph3D filter—to visually encode vector fields. The generated arrow consists of customizable components, including the shaft and tip, whose dimensions and geometric resolution can be adjusted to suit specific visualization requirements. This flexibility allows users to tailor the appearance of the arrows for clarity, aesthetics, or performance depending on the complexity of the dataset being visualized. As a VTK source node, VTKArrowSource does not require input data; instead, it programmatically creates arrow-shaped output that can be directly rendered or further processed downstream in the pipeline. Its primary role is to provide a standardized, parametric representation of direction and magnitude, making it a fundamental tool in vector field visualization applications such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetic field analysis, and other domains where directional information must be conveyed intuitively through 3D glyphs.\",3\n119,MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001,\"A second instance of a Multi Block Leaf node, used sequentially after the first to further process multi-block simulation data\",2\n120,INFO,\"In the context of a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) pipeline, \"\"INFO\"\" refers to a diagnostic or metadata node designed to provide descriptive or contextual information about a dataset flowing through the pipeline. This node typically receives processed data as input and outputs metadata or summary details that characterize the dataset’s structure, properties, or state. Its primary function is to aid in debugging, monitoring, or understanding the data as it moves through various stages of the visualization or processing workflow. By exposing attributes such as data dimensions, data types, array names, or other relevant statistics, the INFO node serves as a utility for developers and users to inspect and validate the integrity and content of their data without altering it. While the exact implementation may vary, its role remains consistent: to act as a non-modifying observer that enhances transparency and facilitates informed decision-making within the VTK pipeline architecture.\",2\n17,VTKMASKPOINTS,\"VTKMaskPoints is a filter in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline designed to selectively subsample or mask points from an input dataset. Its primary purpose is to reduce the number of points—often to decrease glyph density or overall data density—for improved visualization performance and clarity. VTKMaskPoints operates by applying user-defined criteria to select a subset of the original points. These criteria can include specifying a maximum point count, setting a sampling ratio, or performing random selection. By doing so, it enables users to manage large point datasets more efficiently without compromising the essential structure or features of the data. As a named node within a VTK pipeline, VTKMaskPoints integrates seamlessly with other VTK components and is commonly employed in scientific visualization workflows where rendering every point would be computationally expensive or visually overwhelming. The filter is particularly useful when generating glyphs, streamlines, or other point-based visual representations where excessive point density can obscure interpretation. In summary, VTKMaskPoints serves as a versatile and essential tool for point data reduction in VTK-based applications, offering flexible subsampling strategies to balance visual fidelity with computational efficiency.\",4\n18,VTKGLYPH3D,\"vtkGlyph3D is a filter in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) designed to place geometric glyphs—such as arrows or other user-defined graphical objects—at specified points in three-dimensional space. It is commonly employed to visualize vector fields, directional data, or other point-based attributes by mapping data values to the orientation, scale, and type of glyph rendered. The filter accepts input point data and, optionally, associated vector or scalar information that dictates how each glyph is transformed. For instance, vector data can determine the direction in which an arrow glyph points, while scalar values may control its size or color. vtkGlyph3D supports a high degree of customization, allowing users to define the source geometry for the glyph (e.g., a cone, sphere, or custom mesh), specify scaling behavior (including uniform or non-uniform scaling), and choose whether glyph orientation follows input vectors. This capability makes it particularly valuable in scientific visualization applications where representing flow direction, force vectors, or other spatially varying vector quantities is essential. By combining geometric representation with data-driven transformation, vtkGlyph3D provides an intuitive and powerful means of conveying complex multidimensional data in a visually interpretable format.\",6\n55,CUBEFLOW_CUT_PLANE,An example node tree that uses vtkCutter and vtkPlane to slice field data and visualize it with color mapping,2\n71,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001,\"VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001 is a second instance of the VTKArrayCalculator node used within the Cubeflow pipeline. It is identified by the Blender internal node type identifier (bl_idname) \"\"VTKArrayCalculatorType.\"\" This node is specifically configured to perform an additional or subsequent calculation step in the data processing workflow, building upon prior operations in the pipeline. Like other VTKArrayCalculator nodes, it supports multiple calculation-related properties that allow users to define mathematical expressions, select input arrays, and specify output array names and data types. Additionally, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001 includes a custom code extra parameter, enabling advanced users to incorporate tailored logic or extended functionality beyond standard calculator operations. Its role as a secondary instance suggests it operates downstream of an initial VTKArrayCalculator node, likely refining or transforming data further based on the results of earlier computations. This design supports modular and layered data processing, which is essential in complex visualization or simulation pipelines such as those managed by Cubeflow.\",2\n32,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR,\"VTKARRAYCALCULATOR is a VTK-based computational node used to perform mathematical operations on data arrays within a VTK dataset. It functions as a filter in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) ecosystem, enabling users to define and evaluate custom mathematical expressions on existing field data to produce new derived arrays. For example, it can compute the magnitude of a vector field such as 'U' and store the result in a new array named 'magU'. This node is integrated into processing pipelines—such as the Cubeflow pipeline—where it is identified by the bl_idname `VTKArrayCalculatorType` and includes multiple calculation-related properties along with support for custom code via an extra parameter. As a versatile processing unit, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR allows users to generate new field data from existing arrays through user-defined functions, facilitating advanced data analysis and visualization workflows. Its core capability lies in evaluating mathematical expressions applied to scalar or vector data arrays, making it a key tool for computing derived quantities in scientific and engineering simulations that rely on VTK data structures.\",6\n57,VTGLYPH3D,\"A VTK node that places glyphs (e.g., arrows) at points, with options for orientation, scaling, and coloring by vector\",5\n26,VTKCELLCENTERS,\"vtkCellCenters is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter node designed to generate points at the geometric centers of cells within a VTK dataset. This filter operates by taking an input mesh or dataset composed of cells—such as polygons, voxels, or other volumetric or surface elements—and computing the centroid (center point) of each individual cell. The resulting output is a point cloud where each point corresponds to the center of one of the input cells.\n\nIn addition to generating these center points, vtkCellCenters offers functionality to preserve and transfer data from the original cell-based representation to the new point-based output. Specifically, it can copy cell data arrays from the input to point data arrays in the output, effectively converting cell-centered data into point-centered data. This capability is particularly useful in visualization and analysis workflows where operations or representations require data to be associated with points rather than cells.\n\nThe filter may also optionally generate vertex cells—one-point cells that encapsulate each generated point—depending on user configuration. This ensures compatibility with certain VTK pipeline expectations that require explicit cell definitions even for point data.\n\nOverall, vtkCellCenters serves as a bridge between cell-based and point-based data representations in VTK, enabling transformations that are essential for tasks such as seeding particle tracers at cell centers, simplifying complex meshes into representative point sets, or preparing data for algorithms that operate exclusively on point coordinates. Its consistent role across descriptions—as a node or filter that computes and outputs cell centers—affirms its purpose and utility within the VTK processing pipeline.\",3\n121,VTK TO BLENDER PARTICLES,\"VTK To Blender Particles is a specialized node designed to bridge scientific visualization data with 3D animation workflows by converting VTK (Visualization Toolkit) data into Blender particle systems. Specifically, it processes VTK point data—which typically includes spatial coordinates and associated attributes—and translates this information into a format compatible with Blender’s native particle system. This enables users to visualize complex simulation or experimental data, such as fluid flow or particle trajectories, directly within Blender’s rendering and animation environment. The node supports key parameters that enhance its functionality and customization, including the ability to specify an object name (commonly set to 'particles') and to map vector fields—such as a velocity field denoted by 'U'—to influence particle behavior, orientation, or motion within the Blender scene. By focusing on point-based VTK datasets, the node ensures accurate representation of discrete data points as individual particles, preserving their original positions and associated vector or scalar properties. This makes VTK To Blender Particles particularly useful in scientific visualization, where fidelity to the source data is critical, while also leveraging Blender’s powerful rendering capabilities for high-quality visual output.\",1\n123,COLOR MAPPER.001,Color Mapper.001 is a second instance of a color mapping component that applies color to the output of vtkGlyph3D based on scalar data,1\n56,VTMASKPOINTS,\"A VTK node used to subsample points, with parameters like MaximumNumberOfPoints and OnRatio\",1\n59,CUBEFLOW_VECTOR_GLYPHS,A named node tree example demonstrating how to visualize vector fields using glyphs colored by velocity magnitude,1\n20,COLORMAPPER.001,Color Mapper.001 is a second instance of a color mapping component used for a different data stream,3\n21,COLORRAMP.001,Color Ramp.001 is a second lookup table instance corresponding to Color Mapper.001,1\n23,VTKTUBLENDERMESH.002,\"VTK To Blender Mesh.002 is a third mesh converter, associated with glyph-based visualization\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2,MULTI BLOCK LEAF,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,\"The MULTI BLOCK LEAF component serves as a data source that provides or passes extracted block data to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE for the purpose of attribute assignment or modification. Specifically, MULTI BLOCK LEAF processes multi-block datasets and isolates individual leaf blocks, which are then forwarded to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE. This downstream VTK filter, VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, is responsible for assigning or modifying attributes—such as scalars, vectors, tensors, or other field data—on the input dataset based on user-defined specifications. The interaction between these two components is integral in visualization pipelines where attribute manipulation is required after data extraction or decomposition. All descriptions consistently indicate that MULTI BLOCK LEAF’s role is to supply processed block-level data to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, with minor phrasing differences emphasizing either “assignment” alone or “assignment or modification.” These variations are complementary rather than contradictory, as attribute assignment in VTK can inherently include both setting new attributes and modifying existing ones. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding is that MULTI BLOCK LEAF outputs extracted leaf block data to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, enabling the latter to perform necessary attribute operations within the visualization workflow.\",16\n193,VTKARROWSOURCE,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,VTKArrowSource outputs arrow geometry that is converted into a Blender mesh by the VTK To Blender Mesh node,15\n189,MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,Multi Block Leaf.001 outputs processed simulation data to the VTK To Blender Mesh converter for visualization in Blender,14\n192,INFO,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,\"The INFO node and the VTK TO BLENDER MESH node work together in a data processing pipeline to facilitate the integration of scientific or visualization data into Blender. Specifically, the INFO node outputs data—typically derived from VTK (Visualization Toolkit) sources—that is then passed directly to the VTK TO BLENDER MESH node. This downstream node is responsible for converting the received data into a mesh format that is fully compatible with Blender, enabling users to visualize, manipulate, or render the geometry within Blender’s 3D environment. The process ensures that complex datasets, often used in scientific computing or simulation workflows, can be seamlessly translated into a form suitable for artistic or analytical use in Blender. In essence, the INFO node acts as a data provider or intermediary that supplies the necessary geometric or topological information, while the VTK TO BLENDER MESH node performs the critical transformation step, bridging the gap between VTK’s data structures and Blender’s native mesh representation.\",14\n20,VTKMASKPOINTS,VTKGLYPH3D,\"VTKMaskPoints and VTKGlyph3D are two interconnected components commonly used in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline for scientific visualization. VTKMaskPoints serves as a preprocessing filter that takes a dense point dataset and outputs a reduced or subsampled set of points. This reduction is typically employed to manage computational load or improve visual clarity when dealing with large datasets. The resulting subset of points from VTKMaskPoints is specifically designed to retain key spatial characteristics of the original data while decreasing the total number of points.\n\nThis reduced point set generated by VTKMaskPoints is then passed as input—specifically as input 0—to VTKGlyph3D. In the VTK pipeline, VTKGlyph3D uses this input to determine the positions at which glyphs (such as arrows, cones, spheres, or other geometric markers) will be placed. The glyphs themselves are usually defined by a separate source object (e.g., a vector field or another geometric primitive), and their orientation, scale, and type can be controlled by associated point data such as vectors or scalars. By receiving the subsampled point positions from VTKMaskPoints, VTKGlyph3D ensures that glyphs are rendered only at selected locations, avoiding visual clutter and improving performance.\n\nIn summary, VTKMaskPoints acts as a strategic filter that supplies a manageable and representative subset of point data to VTKGlyph3D, which in turn uses these points as placement locations for visual glyphs. This workflow is especially useful in applications like vector field visualization, where rendering a glyph at every original data point would be computationally expensive and visually overwhelming. The integration of VTKMaskPoints and VTKGlyph3D thus enables efficient, scalable, and interpretable visual representations of complex datasets.\",10\n59,CUBEFLOW_CUT_PLANE,VTKCUTTER,The cubeflow_cut_plane example explicitly uses vtkCutter to slice field data,10\n22,VTKGLYPH3D,VTKARROWSOURCE,\"VTKArrowSource and VTKGlyph3D are two interconnected components within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework, commonly used for scientific visualization. VTKArrowSource is a data source object that generates a polygonal representation of an arrow, which serves as a geometric primitive. This arrow geometry is specifically designed to be used as a glyph—a repeated graphical symbol—by VTKGlyph3D. VTKGlyph3D is a filter that places a copy of a specified geometric object (the glyph) at each point in an input dataset, often to visualize vector fields by orienting and scaling the glyphs according to vector data. In this workflow, VTKArrowSource provides the arrow-shaped geometry as input 1 to VTKGlyph3D, effectively defining the visual form of the glyphs that will be replicated and transformed across the dataset. Thus, VTKArrowSource acts as the glyph geometry provider, and VTKGlyph3D uses this geometry to produce the final glyph-based visualization. The relationship is consistent across all descriptions: VTKArrowSource supplies the arrow geometry that VTKGlyph3D employs as its glyph shape, enabling intuitive representation of directional data such as velocity or force vectors.\",9\n83,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001,VTKPROBEFILTER,\"The output of vtkArrayCalculator.001 is used as 'input 1' to the vtkProbeFilter, likely providing field data to be probed\",9\n58,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR,CUBEFLOW_CUT_PLANE,\"While not directly in the cut_plane example, vtkArrayCalculator is part of the broader field data processing toolkit used in similar workflows\",8\n64,VTGLYPH3D,VTKARROWSOURCE,vtkArrowSource is connected as input 1 to vtkGlyph3D to define glyph geometry,8\n32,VTKCELLCENTERS,VTKMASKPOINTS,\"VTKCELLCENTERS and VTKMASKPOINTS are two interconnected components commonly used in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline for processing geometric data. VTKCELLCENTERS is a filter that computes the geometric centers of cells (such as polygons, voxels, or other cell types) in an input dataset and outputs these centers as point data. This effectively converts cell-based representations into a point cloud where each point corresponds to the centroid of an original cell. The resulting point data generated by VTKCELLCENTERS is then typically passed to VTKMASKPOINTS, which acts as a subsampling or filtering mechanism. VTKMASKPOINTS reduces the number of points in the dataset according to specified criteria—such as selecting every Nth point, randomly sampling a fraction of the points, or applying spatial constraints—thereby enabling efficient visualization or processing of large point datasets. In this workflow, VTKCELLCENTERS serves as the source of point data, and VTKMASKPOINTS operates on that data to produce a sparser, more manageable representation. Together, they facilitate a common visualization strategy: first converting complex cell-based geometries into representative point centers, then intelligently reducing the point density to maintain performance without sacrificing essential structural information. This pipeline is especially useful in applications involving large unstructured grids or dense surface meshes where direct rendering would be computationally prohibitive.\",7\n195,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR,VTK TO BLENDER PARTICLES,vtkArrayCalculator outputs processed point data to VTK To Blender Particles for particle system creation,7\n206,VTKGLYPH3D,COLOR MAPPER.001,vtkGlyph3D’s output is sent to Color Mapper.001 for color mapping,7\n63,VTMASKPOINTS,VTGLYPH3D,vtkMaskPoints filters the points from vtkCellCenters before they are passed to vtkGlyph3D,6\n66,VTGLYPH3D,CUBEFLOW_VECTOR_GLYPHS,The cubeflow_vector_glyphs example uses vtkGlyph3D as a core component,6\n24,COLORMAPPER.001,COLORRAMP.001,Color Ramp.001 supplies the lookup table to Color Mapper.001,4\n25,COLORMAPPER.001,VTKTUBLENDERMESH.002,Color Mapper.001 output feeds into VTK To Blender Mesh.002,4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
