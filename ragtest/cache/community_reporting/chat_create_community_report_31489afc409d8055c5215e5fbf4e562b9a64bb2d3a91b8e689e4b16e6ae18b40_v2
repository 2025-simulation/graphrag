Its primary function is to expose structural and quantitative characteristics of the data flowing through the pipeline, enabling users to inspect and validate their data at various stages of processing. \n\nThe node receives processed data as input and outputs key metrics and properties that help in understanding the dataset’s composition. Typical information displayed by the INFO node includes the number of points and cells—fundamental geometric components in VTK datasets—as well as a list of available scalar, vector, or tensor fields (also known as data arrays) associated with the points or cells. This capability makes INFO particularly useful for debugging, verifying data integrity, and ensuring that prior operations in the pipeline (such as filters or readers) have produced the expected results.\n\nIn the broader context of VTK-based workflows, especially those built using node-based visual programming environments like Blender’s BVTKNodes add-on, the INFO node serves as a non-intrusive inspection tool. It does not alter the data passing through it but instead acts as a read-only observer, capturing and presenting relevant metadata without affecting downstream processing. This aligns with its role as a diagnostic utility rather than a data-transforming filter.\n\nAll provided descriptions consistently characterize INFO as a metadata-providing diagnostic node, with no contradictions among them. The descriptions collectively emphasize its function in revealing dataset properties such as size (points and cells) and field availability, and they agree on its placement within a VTK pipeline context—specifically BVTKNodes. Thus, the unified view confirms that INFO is an essential tool for pipeline introspection, offering users immediate, accessible insights into their data’s structure and content without requiring external analysis tools or code modifications.\",3\n185,MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001,\"MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001 is a secondary or subsequent instance of a Multi Block Leaf node within a computational or simulation pipeline. It functions sequentially after the initial Multi Block Leaf node and is specifically employed to further process multi-block simulation data. Its primary role involves refining the selection of blocks within the dataset, building upon the work of the preceding node to enhance precision or granularity in the processing pipeline. As a duplicate or follow-up instance, MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001 ensures that complex multi-block structures are handled iteratively, allowing for more detailed analysis or manipulation in subsequent stages of the workflow. This node is integral to pipelines where hierarchical or staged block processing is required, enabling more sophisticated data refinement than a single leaf node could achieve alone.\",2\n2,MULTI BLOCK LEAF,\"**MULTI BLOCK LEAF** is a VTK pipeline node, identified by the `bl_idname BVTK_Node_MultiBlockLeafType`, designed to extract specific leaf-level datasets from hierarchical multi-block VTK data structures. It functions as a filter within VTK-based visualization and data processing workflows, enabling users to isolate individual blocks—such as the commonly referenced `'internalMesh'`—from complex multi-block datasets, including those generated by simulation tools like OpenFOAM. Positioned typically after a Time Selector node in the pipeline, MULTI BLOCK LEAF acts as an intermediary component that facilitates focused processing on subsets of data by navigating the hierarchical organization of multi-block structures and retrieving terminal (leaf) blocks. This capability is particularly useful in scenarios where downstream operations require access to specific patches or regions of interest within large, nested simulation outputs. The node supports customization through parameters such as `block` (to specify which block to extract) and `custom_code`, enhancing its flexibility in diverse visualization pipelines like those in Cubeflow or BVTKNodes.

This filter is commonly employed in scientific visualization workflows to convert cell-based data into point-based representations, facilitating tasks such as particle placement, vector field visualization, or further point-based processing. The primary function of VTKCellCenters is to take an input dataset—typically composed of cells such as polygons, voxels, or other polyhedral elements—and output a new dataset consisting of points positioned precisely at the centroids of those input cells.\n\nIn addition to generating point coordinates, VTKCellCenters offers optional functionality to copy cell data arrays from the input dataset to the output point data, enabling preservation of relevant attributes during the transformation from cell-based to point-based representation. Some implementations or configurations of the filter also support the generation of vertex cells (i.e., cells of type VTK_VERTEX) for each output point, which can be useful for compatibility with downstream VTK filters that expect a valid cell structure rather than a pure point cloud.\n\nThe filter is widely used in applications where it is necessary to represent cell-centered quantities—such as pressure, temperature, or velocity defined per cell—as point data, particularly when preparing data for glyphing, streamline generation, or particle advection. Its consistent behavior across descriptions underscores its role as a fundamental utility in VTK’s data processing pipeline, bridging the gap between cell-centric and point-centric data models. Regardless of minor variations in phrasing across documentation sources, all descriptions agree on its core purpose: to compute and output points at the centers of input mesh cells, with optional support for data array copying and vertex cell generation.\",6\n102,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001,\"A subsequent array calculation event, differentiated as a second instance in the pipeline\nA second instance of the VTK array calculator node, likely configured for an additional or subsequent calculation step\",2\n43,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR,\"VTKARRAYCALCULATOR is a VTK-based computational filter node designed to perform mathematical operations on data arrays within VTK (Visualization Toolkit) datasets. It functions as a processing node in visualization and data analysis pipelines—such as the Cubeflow pipeline—where it is identified by the bl_idname `VTKArrayCalculatorType`. This node enables users to define custom mathematical expressions that operate on existing point or cell data arrays to generate new derived field data. For instance, it can compute the magnitude of a vector field; a common example involves calculating a new scalar array named 'magU' from an existing vector array 'U' defined on point data. The node supports a range of calculation-related properties and accepts user-defined functions or expressions as input, allowing flexible and dynamic data transformation. Its core functionality centers on evaluating mathematical expressions applied to input VTK data arrays and outputting the results as new arrays, which can then be used for further processing, visualization, or analysis. As a VTK filter, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR integrates seamlessly into VTK’s pipeline architecture, operating on structured or unstructured datasets and maintaining compatibility with VTK’s data model.

The VTK TO BLENDER MESH node takes the data provided by the INFO node and transforms it into a mesh structure that can be fully utilized within Blender’s 3D environment.

The interaction between these two entities forms a critical pipeline in workflows that integrate scientific or engineering simulation data with Blender’s rendering and animation capabilities. MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001 ensures that the data is appropriately processed and organized before handoff, while VTK TO BLENDER MESH handles the final translation into a renderable mesh object within Blender’s environment. Together, they facilitate a seamless transition from simulation results to visual representation, supporting applications in scientific visualization, engineering analysis, and related fields.\",26\n2,MULTI BLOCK LEAF,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,\"The MULTI BLOCK LEAF node functions as a data extraction component within a visualization or data processing pipeline, specifically designed to select and output a single block from a multi-block dataset. This extracted block—often containing mesh or field data—is then passed directly to the VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE filter for further processing. VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE utilizes this input to assign, modify, or designate specific data arrays as active attributes, such as scalars, vectors, or tensors, within the VTK (Visualization Toolkit) framework. In particular, documented usage shows that the mesh data forwarded by MULTI BLOCK LEAF is processed by VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE to explicitly set the pressure field labeled 'p' as the active scalar attribute. Across all descriptions, the consistent operational pattern is that MULTI BLOCK LEAF serves as a source of structured or unstructured grid data derived from a larger multi-block structure, and VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE acts upon this data to configure attribute roles, enabling downstream filters or renderers to correctly interpret and utilize the designated fields. The relationship between the two entities is sequential and functional: MULTI BLOCK LEAF prepares and supplies the relevant dataset subset, while VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE enhances or redefines its attribute metadata to meet the requirements of subsequent pipeline stages.

VTKMaskPoints reduces the number of points in the dataset according to specified criteria—such as keeping every Nth point, randomly selecting a fraction of points, or spatially stratifying the selection—thereby enabling efficient rendering or analysis when dealing with large datasets. Multiple descriptions consistently indicate that the output of VTKCellCenters serves as the input to VTKMaskPoints, and that VTKMaskPoints subsamples or filters this point data.\n\nIn summary, VTKCellCenters generates point data by computing the centers of cells from an input mesh or dataset, and VTKMaskPoints subsequently subsamples this point data to produce a reduced point set. This sequential operation is a common pattern in VTK workflows where cell-derived point representations need to be simplified for performance or clarity.
