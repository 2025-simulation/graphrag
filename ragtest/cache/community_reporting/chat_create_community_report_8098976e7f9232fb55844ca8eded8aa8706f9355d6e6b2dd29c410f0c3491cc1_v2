This filter generates cross-sectional geometry from the input data by intersecting it with the cutting function. The resulting output typically consists of contour lines or surfaces that represent the intersection of the input geometry with the specified cut plane. vtkCutter supports the creation of both contour lines and triangulated surfaces, depending on configuration settings. However, certain parameters may need to be explicitly managed; for instance, to achieve specific output types, users might need to disable options such as GenerateCutScalars and GenerateTriangles. The filter operates on a variety of input dataset types and is particularly useful in scientific visualization for revealing internal structures or creating slices through volumetric or surface data. As an implicit-function-based cutter, vtkCutter is flexible and can theoretically work with any implicit function (e.g., spheres, cylinders), though in practice it is most frequently employed with planar cuts. The node processes field data and geometric representations alike, making it a versatile tool in VTK-based data processing pipelines for generating cross-sectional views or extracting boundary contours at specified locations within the dataset.\",13\n9,VTKPLANE,\"VTKPLANE (commonly referred to as vtkPlane) is a VTK implicit function class used to define an infinite plane in 3D space, primarily for slicing, clipping, or cutting operations within VTK-based visualization pipelines. It is implemented as a geometric object node that specifies a plane using two key parameters: an origin point and a normal vector. This definition allows the plane to extend infinitely in all directions perpendicular to the normal, making it suitable as an implicit function for operations such as those performed by vtkCutter.\n\nIn the context of custom implementations—such as the one defined in custom_nodes/VTKOthers.py—VTKPLANE serves as a specialized VTK node type that integrates into visual programming environments (e.g., Blender-based VTK workflows), where it can be configured either through direct numerical input of the normal and origin or by linking to external geometric objects like Blender empties or other scene elements. The plane defined by VTKPLANE acts as a cutting surface that intersects volumetric or mesh-based datasets, enabling users to extract cross-sectional views or isolate specific regions of interest.\n\nAs an implicit function, vtkPlane evaluates the signed distance from any point in space to the plane, which is fundamental for determining which parts of a dataset lie above, below, or on the cutting plane. This functionality is essential in scientific visualization for tasks such as data exploration, simulation analysis, and interactive slicing of 3D cell data. The class is consistently described across sources as a core component in VTK pipelines where planar sectioning is required, and its role is unambiguous: it does not generate visible geometry itself but instead provides the mathematical definition of a plane used by other VTK filters (notably vtkCutter) to perform geometric operations.\n\nAll descriptions align in emphasizing that VTKPLANE is defined solely by its origin and normal vector, with no contradictions regarding its purpose or parameters. Its primary and consistent use case is as a cutting or clipping function in visualization workflows, underscoring its importance as a foundational tool in VTK-based data analysis and rendering systems.\",8\n8,VTKSTRUCTUREDGRIDREADER,\"VTKStructuredGridReader (also referred to as vtkStructuredGridReader) is a VTK reader class designed to load structured grid datasets from files stored on disk in VTK format. It functions as a foundational data source in the VTK visualization pipeline, commonly serving as the root input for multiple downstream processing branches. The component reads structured grid data, which includes not only the geometric and topological structure of the grid but also associated data attributes such as scalars, vectors, and tensors. These attributes enable rich, multi-dimensional analysis and visualization of scientific datasets.\n\nOnce the data is read, VTKStructuredGridReader outputs it to various VTK filters and visualization components. It is frequently used as a direct input to vtkStreamTracer, a filter that computes streamlines for vector fields, highlighting its role in flow visualization and related computational tasks. Beyond this specific use case, the reader supports a broad range of pipeline configurations, providing input to multiple filters simultaneously and enabling complex data processing workflows.\n\nAs a dedicated VTK node type, VTKStructuredGridReader is optimized for structured grids—datasets where points are arranged in a regular, rectangular lattice, allowing for efficient storage and access. Its ability to parse and expose field data, including scalar and vector properties, makes it essential for applications requiring detailed spatial analysis. Overall, VTKStructuredGridReader serves as a critical entry point for structured grid data in VTK-based applications, bridging file-based data storage with interactive or batch-mode visualization and analysis pipelines.\",5\n339,VTKCUTTERTYPE,Blender node type identifier for the vtkCutter VTK filter,2\n42,VTKRESAMPLETOIMAGE,\"VTKRESAMPLETOIMAGE is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter designed to convert arbitrary VTK datasets—whether unstructured or structured—into a uniform 3D image grid, also known as a voxel grid. This processing node resamples input data onto a regular lattice defined by user-specified sampling dimensions and spatial bounds, effectively transforming complex or irregular data representations into a consistent image dataset format. By doing so, VTKRESAMPLETOIMAGE facilitates downstream operations that require or benefit from regular grid structures, such as volume rendering, image-based analysis, or compatibility with image processing pipelines. The filter ensures that the output maintains spatial fidelity relative to the original data within the defined bounds, making it a valuable tool for standardizing diverse data types into a common volumetric representation within the VTK framework.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n14,VTKCUTTER,VTKPOLYDATANORMALS,vtkCutter’s output polydata is processed by vtkPolyDataNormals to compute consistent surface normals,23\n13,VTKPLANE,VTKCUTTER,\"VTKPlane and VTKCutter are closely integrated components within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) used for slicing or cutting geometric or volumetric data. VTKPlane serves as the implicit cutting function that defines the geometry of a planar surface used to slice through input datasets. Specifically, VTKPlane provides the CutFunction input to VTKCutter, effectively determining the orientation and position of the cutting plane. This plane is mathematically defined by a point and a normal vector, enabling VTKCutter to compute intersections between the plane and the input data—whether it be structured grids, unstructured meshes, or other geometric representations. VTKCutter then uses this cutting function to generate contour lines, cross-sectional surfaces, or other derived geometry that represents the intersection of the input data with the defined plane. In essence, VTKPlane supplies the cutting surface (a flat, infinite plane) that VTKCutter leverages to perform its slice operation, making VTKPlane an essential prerequisite for planar cutting operations in VTK. The relationship is unidirectional: VTKCutter depends on VTKPlane (or another implicit function) to specify how the cut should be made, while VTKPlane operates independently as a geometric definition tool. Together, they enable users to extract meaningful cross-sections from complex 3D data for visualization, analysis, or further processing.\",21\n11,VTKSTRUCTUREDGRIDREADER,VTKCUTTER,\"vtkStructuredGridReader and vtkCutter are two interoperable components within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework, working in tandem to enable data slicing operations. Specifically, vtkStructuredGridReader is responsible for reading structured grid datasets from external files and supplying this input data to vtkCutter. The structured grid format consists of points arranged in a regular lattice, typically defined by i-j-k indexing, and is commonly used in scientific visualization for representing simulation or measurement data with a regular topology.\n\nOnce vtkStructuredGridReader loads the structured grid data, it passes this dataset as input to vtkCutter, which performs slicing operations by intersecting the dataset with a specified implicit function—such as a plane, sphere, or other geometric surface. The result of this operation is a set of contour lines or cross-sectional geometry that reveals internal structures or features of the original dataset. This workflow is essential in applications requiring cross-sectional analysis, such as medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics, or geospatial visualization.\n\nIn summary, vtkStructuredGridReader serves as the data ingestion component that provides the structured grid to vtkCutter, which then processes the data by cutting through it with user-defined geometric functions to generate meaningful visual slices.
