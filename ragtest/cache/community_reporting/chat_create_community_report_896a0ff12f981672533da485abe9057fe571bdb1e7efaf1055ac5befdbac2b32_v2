The filter operates within the broader context of VTK-m—a high-performance computing library for scientific visualization—and is part of a suite of computational filters that enable data transformation and analysis on both CPU and GPU architectures. In the Blender integration of VTK-m (or a similar node-based visualization system), this filter is exposed as a node with the bl_idname identifier 'VTKmPointElevationType', allowing users to incorporate elevation-based attribute generation into their data processing pipelines.
