It provided basic mesh export functionality, enabling users to bring in geometric data generated by simulation or analysis tools that output in VTK format. Over time, this initial implementation was succeeded by an improved and more robust node known as “VTK To Blender Mesh,” which expanded upon the original’s capabilities and addressed limitations in functionality or usability. As a result, the original VTK TO BLENDER node is now considered outdated and has been effectively superseded within the Blender ecosystem.
