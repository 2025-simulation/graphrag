It serves as an output node in visualization workflows, converting various VTK data structures—including polygonal data (polydata), unstructured grids, structured grids, and general VTK datasets—into native Blender mesh geometry suitable for 3D rendering, modeling, or further manipulation within Blender’s environment.\n\nThis node replaces an earlier implementation known as “VTK To Blender” and includes enhanced functionality for mesh conversion. It supports configurable properties such as a user-defined name for the resulting Blender object and offers optional features like automatic material generation (required for displaying color data from VTK) and mesh smoothing. The node can extract all boundary surfaces from input VTK data and is designed to integrate seamlessly into Blender scenes by producing standard mesh objects recognized by Blender’s internal systems.\n\nAs a terminal component in the VTK-to-Blender pipeline, VTK To Blender Mesh does not produce further VTK output but instead finalizes the data flow by delivering geometry ready for visualization or editing in Blender. It is identified internally by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_VTKToBlenderMeshType` and typically receives input from upstream VTK processing nodes, such as `vtkPolyDataReader`. The node is specifically engineered for compatibility with Blender’s 3D graphics environment, ensuring that simulation results, contour outputs, and other VTK visualization data are accurately represented as editable and renderable mesh objects.\",24\n79,3D VIEWPORT,,1\n6,COLOR RAMP,\"Color Ramp is a Blender-VTK visualization node that defines a configurable lookup table—often in the form of a color gradient or ramp—used to map scalar data values to corresponding colors within a VTK-based visualization pipeline. This node serves as a critical component in data-driven rendering workflows, particularly in Blender environments integrated with VTK (Visualization Toolkit), where it supplies the color mapping logic consumed by the Color Mapper node. The Color Ramp enables users to visually represent scalar field data by assigning specific colors across a defined range of values, facilitating intuitive interpretation of complex datasets.\n\nThe node supports customization through user-defined color gradients and includes built-in presets derived from matplotlib, offering a range of scientifically and aesthetically useful color schemes. It can accommodate up to 32 discrete color samples, allowing for fine-grained control over the appearance of the resulting visualization. Additionally, the Color Ramp may utilize texture-based color definitions, further expanding its flexibility in defining how data values translate into rendered colors.\n\nFunctionally, the Color Ramp generates or supplies a lookup table that the Color Mapper references to apply consistent and meaningful color schemes during the rendering process. This lookup table acts as an intermediary between raw numerical data and its visual representation, ensuring that variations in scalar values are accurately and effectively communicated through color. The node is consistently described across sources as integral to visualization pipelines, particularly those involving scientific or engineering data where color-coded representations enhance analytical insight.\n\nIn summary, Color Ramp is a versatile and essential node in Blender-VTK workflows, providing a configurable, preset-supported, and texture-capable mechanism for defining how scalar data is mapped to colors via a lookup table, ultimately enabling effective, data-driven visualizations.\",4\n7,COLOR MAPPER,\"Color Mapper is a VTK-based visualization node used within Blender’s VTK integration framework to map scalar (and occasionally vector) data to visual color representations. It functions as a key component in rendering pipelines by applying color mapping to input data based on selected scalar array attributes. The node utilizes a lookup table—typically sourced from a connected Color Ramp node—to translate numerical data values into corresponding colors, enabling intuitive visual interpretation of field or attribute data. This lookup table can be customized through user-defined settings or custom code, and the resulting colored output is often passed downstream to other nodes such as “VTK To Blender Mesh.001” for final mesh rendering. The Color Mapper supports various coloring strategies and may incorporate texture settings to enhance visual representation. Its primary role is to bridge raw scientific or simulation data with visual aesthetics by assigning colors according to data magnitude or category, making it essential for data-driven visualization workflows in Blender environments that leverage VTK (Visualization Toolkit) capabilities.\",12\n77,MATPLOTLIB,\"Matplotlib is an open-source Python library widely used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. It provides a comprehensive suite of tools for generating high-quality plots and charts, and is a foundational component of the scientific Python ecosystem. Among its many features, Matplotlib includes a rich collection of color maps—predefined gradients and palettes that map scalar data to colors. These color maps are not only integral to Matplotlib’s own plotting functions but are also adopted as standard presets in external tools and libraries. Specifically, the color maps from Matplotlib are used as presets in the Color Ramp node of BVtkNodes, a set of Blender nodes for scientific visualization that interface with the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). This integration allows users of BVtkNodes to leverage Matplotlib’s well-designed and perceptually uniform color schemes directly within Blender’s node-based workflow, enhancing the visual clarity and aesthetic quality of data-driven renderings. As an open-source project, Matplotlib is freely available and actively maintained by a large community of developers and researchers, ensuring continuous improvement and broad compatibility across platforms and applications.\",2\n179,VTKELEVATIONFILTER,\"vtkElevationFilter is a processing node within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework that assigns scalar values to data points based on their elevation relative to a specified low point and high point. This filter operates by computing the projection of each point in the input dataset onto a line defined by these two user-defined endpoints, effectively mapping geometric height or position along that axis to a scalar value. The resulting scalar field is commonly used in visualization pipelines to color or otherwise enhance the representation of datasets—such as surfaces or 3D models—according to their relative elevation. By transforming spatial coordinates into meaningful scalar data, vtkElevationFilter facilitates intuitive visual analysis, particularly in applications like terrain modeling, scientific visualization, and geometric feature highlighting. Its integration into VTK’s pipeline architecture allows it to seamlessly process various dataset types, making it a versatile tool for generating elevation-based visual effects or preparing data for further computational analysis.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n1195,VTKCONESOURCE,GENERATED_NODES/GEN_VTKSOURCES.PY,VTKConeSource is implemented in the module generated_nodes/gen_VTKSources.py,78\n45,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER,vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter outputs surface geometry that is then converted into a Blender mesh by the VTK To Blender Mesh node,28\n108,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,3D VIEWPORT,The output of VTK To Blender Mesh is displayed in the 3D Viewport when in appropriate rendering mode,25\n5,COLOR RAMP,COLOR MAPPER,\"COLOR RAMP and COLOR MAPPER work in tandem within a visualization pipeline to translate scalar data values into meaningful visual colors. Specifically, COLOR RAMP serves as the source of the color gradient or lookup table that defines how data values correspond to specific colors. This lookup table typically consists of a continuous or discrete spectrum of colors arranged according to a chosen gradient—such as viridis, jet, grayscale, or custom palettes. The COLOR MAPPER then utilizes this predefined COLOR RAMP to perform the actual mapping of scalar field values (e.g., temperature, elevation, pressure) to their respective visual representations. In essence, COLOR RAMP configures or feeds into COLOR MAPPER by supplying the necessary color information, enabling the mapper to assign appropriate colors to data points based on their magnitude or category. This relationship ensures that visualizations—such as heatmaps, contour plots, or volume renderings—are both aesthetically coherent and data-accurate. The repeated emphasis across descriptions confirms that COLOR RAMP’s primary role is to provide the lookup table, while COLOR MAPPER’s function is to apply that table to map numerical or categorical data onto a color scale for effective visual interpretation. There are no contradictions among the descriptions; rather, they consistently reinforce this complementary, dependency-based interaction between the two components.\",16\n7,COLOR MAPPER,COLOR RAMP,\"The Color Ramp and Color Mapper are closely integrated components within a visualization system, where the Color Ramp serves as the source of the lookup table (also referred to as a color gradient) that defines how scalar values are translated into visual colors.

This process enables the Color Mapper to assign appropriate colors to data points based on their scalar values, facilitating effective visual encoding and representation. The connection between the two is direct: the Color Ramp is linked to the lookup table input of the Color Mapper, ensuring that any adjustments or definitions made within the Color Ramp—such as the selection of color gradients or interpolation methods—are immediately reflected in how the Color Mapper applies color across the dataset. In essence, the Color Ramp acts as the configurational backbone for color definition, while the Color Mapper executes the actual mapping process during rendering or visualization. Together, they form a cohesive pipeline for transforming numerical data into intuitive, color-based visual outputs.\",16\n107,COLOR RAMP,MATPLOTLIB,Color Ramp uses colormap presets exported from Matplotlib,6\n300,VTKELEVATIONFILTER,VTKCONESOURCE,\"VTKELEVATIONFILTER and VTKCONESOURCE are two components commonly used together in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline for generating and processing 3D geometric data. Specifically, VTKCONESOURCE is a data source object that generates a polygonal cone geometry. This cone consists of a base, a tip, and connecting sides, and it serves as a basic primitive shape often used for visualization demonstrations or as input for further processing. The geometry produced by VTKCONESOURCE includes points, polygons, and normals, and it can be customized through parameters such as height, radius, resolution, and direction.\n\nThis output geometry from VTKCONESOURCE is then used as input to VTKELEVATIONFILTER. The VTKELEVATIONFILTER is a filter that assigns scalar values to the points of the input dataset based on their elevation along a specified axis—typically from a minimum to a maximum value mapped linearly across the dataset’s spatial extent along that axis. In this context, the cone geometry generated by VTKCONESOURCE provides the spatial structure onto which the elevation-based scalar mapping is applied. The resulting dataset retains the original geometry but now includes scalar data at each point, which can be used for color mapping or other visualization techniques that rely on scalar fields.\n\nBoth descriptions consistently indicate that VTKCONESOURCE acts as the upstream data producer, while VTKELEVATIONFILTER acts as the downstream processor that enriches the geometric data with scalar elevation information. There are no contradictions between the provided descriptions; rather, they reinforce the same functional relationship: VTKCONESOURCE outputs geometry that serves as input to VTKELEVATIONFILTER for scalar elevation mapping. This pipeline is typical in VTK workflows where synthetic geometries are created and then augmented with derived data for visualization purposes.\",4\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
