It enables users to apply custom code logic to input datasets, offering flexibility for specialized data processing tasks that are not covered by standard VTK filters. This node receives input data—often time-selected data from a Time Selector node—and processes it according to user-specified logic before passing the results downstream in the pipeline. Typical downstream consumers of the Custom Filter’s output include nodes such as vtkAssignAttribute and vtkThreshold, which handle attribute assignment and data thresholding, respectively. The Custom Filter thus serves as an intermediary processing step that bridges time-based data selection with subsequent attribute manipulation and filtering operations. In a recent update, the node was enhanced to resolve issues related to tree import and export functionality, improving its reliability and integration within larger VTK-based workflows. By allowing users to inject custom algorithms directly into the visualization pipeline, Custom Filter provides a powerful mechanism for extending VTK’s native capabilities while maintaining compatibility with the broader BVTKNodes architecture.\",6\n48,VTKTHRESHOLD,\"VTKTHRESHOLD (commonly referred to as vtkThreshold) is a VTK filter class used within VTK-based visualization and data processing pipelines—particularly in the BVTKNodes system—to extract cells or points from a dataset based on user-defined scalar threshold values applied to data attributes. This filter operates by evaluating a specified scalar attribute (such as 'p') and retaining only those cells or points where the attribute’s value falls within a defined range, typically bounded by two parameters: Value1 and Value2. For instance, it can be configured to extract data where the attribute 'p' lies between 0.02 and 0.03.  \n\nThe vtkThreshold node functions as a filtering component in pipeline architectures, commonly receiving input from a Custom Filter and passing its output to subsequent processing nodes such as vtkBoxClipDataSet. Its implementation is referenced in multiple code locations, including 'generated_nodes/gen_VTKFilters1.py' and 'custom_nodes/VTKFilters.py', indicating its integration into both automatically generated and manually customized portions of the BVTKNodes framework. Additionally, its core functionality has been extended through custom Python code to enhance thresholding operations, enabling more flexible or application-specific data extraction logic.\n\nAs a standard VTK filter, vtkThreshold supports both cell- and point-based thresholding, depending on the nature of the input dataset and the selected attribute. It serves as a critical tool for isolating regions of interest in scientific visualization workflows by allowing users to focus on subsets of data that meet specific quantitative criteria. Within the BVTKNodes ecosystem, it is exposed as a visual programming node, making it accessible to users building VTK pipelines through graphical interfaces. Overall, VTKTHRESHOLD provides a robust, configurable mechanism for data subsetting based on scalar field thresholds, playing a key role in preprocessing and analysis stages of VTK-based applications.\",9\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n71,CUSTOM FILTER,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,\"The CUSTOM FILTER is a data processing component whose output is specifically designed to be consumed by VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE. After the CUSTOM FILTER generates its output dataset, this data is passed directly to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, which is responsible for assigning specific attributes to the data. This pipeline arrangement ensures that the data produced by the CUSTOM FILTER undergoes subsequent attribute assignment as part of a structured visualization or analysis workflow. Multiple descriptions consistently indicate that the CUSTOM FILTER does not perform attribute assignment itself; instead, it relies on VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE to handle this task. Thus, the relationship between the two entities is sequential and complementary: the CUSTOM FILTER serves as a data source or transformation step, and VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE acts on that output to define or modify data attributes such as scalars, vectors, tensors, or other field data characteristics. This design aligns with typical Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline conventions, where filters produce data and attribute assignment modules refine metadata for downstream rendering or computation.\",16\n74,VTKTHRESHOLD,VTKBOXCLIPDATASET,vtkThreshold outputs filtered data to vtkBoxClipDataSet for spatial clipping,14\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
