Identified by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_MultiBlockLeafType`, it functions as a filter within a VTK pipeline, typically positioned downstream of a Time Selector node. This node enables users to navigate and isolate specific components—often referred to as “leaf blocks”—from hierarchical, multi-block datasets commonly generated by simulation tools such as OpenFOAM. These leaf blocks represent the terminal or atomic datasets within the multi-block hierarchy, which can then be subjected to further analysis, processing, or visualization.\n\nThe MULTI BLOCK LEAF node is an integral part of data processing pipelines in environments like Cubeflow, where it supports the selective extraction of patches or subdomains from complex simulation outputs. It accepts multi-block datasets as input and uses user-defined parameters—such as a block index or identifier—to specify which leaf block to extract. Additional configuration options, including `custom_code` and `block` parameters, allow for flexible and programmable control over the extraction process. By isolating individual datasets from a larger multi-block structure, MULTI BLOCK LEAF facilitates focused downstream operations, such as rendering specific regions of interest, applying localized filters, or exporting subsets of simulation data. Its consistent role across descriptions underscores its purpose as a specialized selector within VTK pipelines, bridging high-level multi-block data organization with granular, block-level manipulation.\",8\n119,MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001,\"A second instance of a Multi Block Leaf node, used sequentially after the first to further process multi-block simulation data\",2\n120,INFO,\"In the context of a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) pipeline, \"\"INFO\"\" refers to a diagnostic or metadata node designed to provide descriptive or contextual information about a dataset flowing through the pipeline. This node typically receives processed data as input and outputs metadata or summary details that characterize the dataset’s structure, properties, or state. Its primary function is to aid in debugging, monitoring, or understanding the data as it moves through various stages of the visualization or processing workflow. By exposing attributes such as data dimensions, data types, array names, or other relevant statistics, the INFO node serves as a utility for developers and users to inspect and validate the integrity and content of their data without altering it. While the exact implementation may vary, its role remains consistent: to act as a non-modifying observer that enhances transparency and facilitates informed decision-making within the VTK pipeline architecture.\",2\n55,CUBEFLOW_CUT_PLANE,An example node tree that uses vtkCutter and vtkPlane to slice field data and visualize it with color mapping,2\n71,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001,\"VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001 is a second instance of the VTKArrayCalculator node used within the Cubeflow pipeline. It is identified by the Blender internal node type identifier (bl_idname) \"\"VTKArrayCalculatorType.\"\" This node is specifically configured to perform an additional or subsequent calculation step in the data processing workflow, building upon prior operations in the pipeline. Like other VTKArrayCalculator nodes, it supports multiple calculation-related properties that allow users to define mathematical expressions, select input arrays, and specify output array names and data types. Additionally, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR.001 includes a custom code extra parameter, enabling advanced users to incorporate tailored logic or extended functionality beyond standard calculator operations. Its role as a secondary instance suggests it operates downstream of an initial VTKArrayCalculator node, likely refining or transforming data further based on the results of earlier computations.

It functions as a filter in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) ecosystem, enabling users to define and evaluate custom mathematical expressions on existing field data to produce new derived arrays. For example, it can compute the magnitude of a vector field such as 'U' and store the result in a new array named 'magU'. This node is integrated into processing pipelines—such as the Cubeflow pipeline—where it is identified by the bl_idname `VTKArrayCalculatorType` and includes multiple calculation-related properties along with support for custom code via an extra parameter. As a versatile processing unit, VTKARRAYCALCULATOR allows users to generate new field data from existing arrays through user-defined functions, facilitating advanced data analysis and visualization workflows. Its core capability lies in evaluating mathematical expressions applied to scalar or vector data arrays, making it a key tool for computing derived quantities in scientific and engineering simulations that rely on VTK data structures.\",6\n26,VTKCELLCENTERS,\"vtkCellCenters is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter node designed to generate points at the geometric centers of cells within a VTK dataset. This filter operates by taking an input mesh or dataset composed of cells—such as polygons, voxels, or other volumetric or surface elements—and computing the centroid (center point) of each individual cell. The resulting output is a point cloud where each point corresponds to the center of one of the input cells.\n\nIn addition to generating these center points, vtkCellCenters offers functionality to preserve and transfer data from the original cell-based representation to the new point-based output. Specifically, it can copy cell data arrays from the input to point data arrays in the output, effectively converting cell-centered data into point-centered data. This capability is particularly useful in visualization and analysis workflows where operations or representations require data to be associated with points rather than cells.\n\nThe filter may also optionally generate vertex cells—one-point cells that encapsulate each generated point—depending on user configuration. This ensures compatibility with certain VTK pipeline expectations that require explicit cell definitions even for point data.\n\nOverall, vtkCellCenters serves as a bridge between cell-based and point-based data representations in VTK, enabling transformations that are essential for tasks such as seeding particle tracers at cell centers, simplifying complex meshes into representative point sets, or preparing data for algorithms that operate exclusively on point coordinates. Its consistent role across descriptions—as a node or filter that computes and outputs cell centers—affirms its purpose and utility within the VTK processing pipeline.\",3\n121,VTK TO BLENDER PARTICLES,\"VTK To Blender Particles is a specialized node designed to bridge scientific visualization data with 3D animation workflows by converting VTK (Visualization Toolkit) data into Blender particle systems. Specifically, it processes VTK point data—which typically includes spatial coordinates and associated attributes—and translates this information into a format compatible with Blender’s native particle system. This enables users to visualize complex simulation or experimental data, such as fluid flow or particle trajectories, directly within Blender’s rendering and animation environment. The node supports key parameters that enhance its functionality and customization, including the ability to specify an object name (commonly set to 'particles') and to map vector fields—such as a velocity field denoted by 'U'—to influence particle behavior, orientation, or motion within the Blender scene. By focusing on point-based VTK datasets, the node ensures accurate representation of discrete data points as individual particles, preserving their original positions and associated vector or scalar properties. This makes VTK To Blender Particles particularly useful in scientific visualization, where fidelity to the source data is critical, while also leveraging Blender’s powerful rendering capabilities for high-quality visual output.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n2,MULTI BLOCK LEAF,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,\"The MULTI BLOCK LEAF component serves as a data source that provides or passes extracted block data to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE for the purpose of attribute assignment or modification.

This downstream VTK filter, VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, is responsible for assigning or modifying attributes—such as scalars, vectors, tensors, or other field data—on the input dataset based on user-defined specifications. The interaction between these two components is integral in visualization pipelines where attribute manipulation is required after data extraction or decomposition. All descriptions consistently indicate that MULTI BLOCK LEAF’s role is to supply processed block-level data to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, with minor phrasing differences emphasizing either “assignment” alone or “assignment or modification.” These variations are complementary rather than contradictory, as attribute assignment in VTK can inherently include both setting new attributes and modifying existing ones. Therefore, the comprehensive understanding is that MULTI BLOCK LEAF outputs extracted leaf block data to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, enabling the latter to perform necessary attribute operations within the visualization workflow.\",16\n189,MULTI BLOCK LEAF.001,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,Multi Block Leaf.001 outputs processed simulation data to the VTK To Blender Mesh converter for visualization in Blender,14\n192,INFO,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,\"The INFO node and the VTK TO BLENDER MESH node work together in a data processing pipeline to facilitate the integration of scientific or visualization data into Blender.

This downstream node is responsible for converting the received data into a mesh format that is fully compatible with Blender, enabling users to visualize, manipulate, or render the geometry within Blender’s 3D environment. The process ensures that complex datasets, often used in scientific computing or simulation workflows, can be seamlessly translated into a form suitable for artistic or analytical use in Blender.

This effectively converts cell-based representations into a point cloud where each point corresponds to the centroid of an original cell. The resulting point data generated by VTKCELLCENTERS is then typically passed to VTKMASKPOINTS, which acts as a subsampling or filtering mechanism. VTKMASKPOINTS reduces the number of points in the dataset according to specified criteria—such as selecting every Nth point, randomly sampling a fraction of the points, or applying spatial constraints—thereby enabling efficient visualization or processing of large point datasets. In this workflow, VTKCELLCENTERS serves as the source of point data, and VTKMASKPOINTS operates on that data to produce a sparser, more manageable representation. Together, they facilitate a common visualization strategy: first converting complex cell-based geometries into representative point centers, then intelligently reducing the point density to maintain performance without sacrificing essential structural information. This pipeline is especially useful in applications involving large unstructured grids or dense surface meshes where direct rendering would be computationally prohibitive.\",7\n195,VTKARRAYCALCULATOR,VTK TO BLENDER PARTICLES,vtkArrayCalculator outputs processed point data to VTK To Blender Particles for particle system creation,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
