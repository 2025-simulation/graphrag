It functions as a source node, typically serving as the initial data input in workflows such as those in Cubeflow or Blender-integrated VTK environments. The node is defined in the file `generated_nodes/gen_VTKReaders.py` and carries the `bl_idname` identifier `VTKOpenFOAMReaderType`.\n\nThis reader is specifically configured to load OpenFOAM case files, commonly referenced with a path such as `$/cubeflow/case.foam`. It supports a variety of configurable properties that allow users to control how simulation data is processed and visualized. These properties include file path specification, time step selection or handling, data format options (such as precision settings, including support for 64-bit floats), and mesh-related behaviors like mesh caching. Additionally, the node offers capabilities such as enabling all patch arrays via custom methods like `EnableAllPatchArrays()` and performing data conversions like cell-to-point interpolation.\n\nVTKOpenFOAMReader integrates seamlessly into VTK-based pipelines, enabling the loading of complex OpenFOAM simulation outputs—including mesh geometry and field data—into a format suitable for visualization, analysis, and further processing. Its design emphasizes flexibility, allowing users to tailor data ingestion to specific simulation requirements. The node is also referenced in documentation examples, such as those involving boundary surface extraction, highlighting its utility in practical CFD post-processing tasks. Overall, VTKOpenFOAMReader serves as a critical bridge between OpenFOAM simulation results and VTK-powered visualization ecosystems.\",13\n1,TIME SELECTOR,\"TIME SELECTOR is a VTK-based processing node used in data pipelines—particularly within the BVTKNodes framework in Blender—to select specific time steps from time-varying simulation data. Identified by the `bl_idname` `BVTK_Node_TimeSelectorType`, it functions as a filtering node that enables temporal slicing of datasets by allowing users to specify which time step(s) to extract for downstream processing. The node typically receives input from a time-series data reader such as `vtkOpenFOAMReader` and passes the selected temporal slice to subsequent nodes, such as a Custom Filter.\n\nThe TIME SELECTOR supports configuration through parameters like `time_index`, which determines the specific time step to extract from the input data. Descriptions indicate that this parameter can be set to various values—examples include index 1 or index 5—depending on the user’s needs, demonstrating its flexibility. Additionally, the node may include advanced options such as `use_scene_time` and `custom_code`, enhancing its integration within Blender-based VTK workflows.\n\nAs a core component in VTK/Blender data pipelines, the TIME SELECTOR plays a critical role in managing time-dependent simulation outputs, allowing users to isolate and process individual time steps from complex, multi-timestep datasets. It is consistently described as a filter that operates on time-varying simulation data, enabling focused analysis or visualization of specific moments in a simulation sequence. Its placement in the pipeline is typically downstream of data readers and upstream of further processing or rendering nodes, ensuring that only the desired temporal data progresses through the workflow.\n\nIn summary, TIME SELECTOR is a configurable, time-index-driven filtering node in VTK-based pipelines designed to extract user-specified time steps from time-series simulation data, commonly used in conjunction with `vtkOpenFOAMReader` and integrated into Blender via the BVTKNodes system.\",6\n62,OPENFOAM,\"OPENFOAM is an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software suite widely used for simulating fluid flow, heat transfer, and related physical phenomena.

This interoperability supports researchers and engineers in exploring and interpreting complex fluid dynamics results through advanced graphical representations.

The vtkOpenFOAMReader is responsible for reading and outputting simulation data generated by OpenFOAM, specifically in the form of time-series or time-varying data that spans multiple timesteps. This raw simulation data is then directly fed as input to the Time Selector node, which serves as the first processing step in the pipeline. The primary function of the Time Selector is to perform temporal filtering or selection by allowing users to choose specific timesteps from the time-varying dataset provided by the vtkOpenFOAMReader. This connection is explicit and direct: the output of the vtkOpenFOAMReader is consumed exclusively by the Time Selector at this stage, enabling downstream operations to work with a user-specified subset of the temporal data. Together, these components facilitate efficient handling and analysis of transient simulation results by decoupling data ingestion from temporal selection, ensuring that only relevant timesteps are processed further in the visualization or analysis workflow.\",19\n1,TIME SELECTOR,MULTI BLOCK LEAF,\"The Time Selector and Multi Block Leaf are two interconnected nodes in a data processing pipeline, working sequentially to extract specific subsets of simulation or computational data. The Time Selector functions as a time-filtering component that receives multi-block input data and allows users to select one or more specific timesteps. It then outputs this time-filtered, multi-block dataset to the Multi Block Leaf node. The primary role of the Time Selector is to isolate data corresponding to chosen temporal points, ensuring that only relevant time-specific information is passed downstream for further processing.\n\nThe Multi Block Leaf node receives the time-filtered multi-block data from the Time Selector and performs hierarchical data processing to extract individual blocks or leaf-level datasets from the structured multi-block hierarchy. A common use case involves extracting a specific mesh block, such as the 'internalMesh', which represents the core computational domain in many simulation frameworks. The Multi Block Leaf is designed to navigate the block structure of the input data and isolate the desired component—whether referred to as a “block,” “leaf block,” or “leaf-level dataset”—based on user configuration.\n\nTogether, the Time Selector and Multi Block Leaf enable a two-stage extraction process: first, temporal selection of relevant simulation timesteps, followed by spatial or structural selection of specific data blocks within those timesteps. This workflow supports efficient and targeted analysis of large, complex datasets by reducing both temporal and structural scope. All descriptions consistently affirm that the Time Selector outputs time-specific or time-filtered data to the Multi Block Leaf, which then carries out the actual block or dataset extraction. There are no contradictions among the provided descriptions; instead, they reinforce a coherent operational sequence where the Time Selector precedes and feeds into the Multi Block Leaf in a unidirectional data flow.\",18\n94,OPENFOAM,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,vtkOpenFOAMReader is specifically designed to read OpenFOAM simulation output files,17\n50,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,$/CUBEFLOW/CASE.FOAM,vtkOpenFOAMReader reads simulation data from the file path $/cubeflow/case.foam,14\n101,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,ENABLEALLPATCHARRAYS(),EnableAllPatchArrays() is a custom code method applied to the vtkOpenFOAMReader node to expose patch data,14\n329,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,BVTK NODE TIMESSELECTORTYPE,TimeSelector node likely processes time-step data output from VTKOpenFOAMReader,14\n85,CUBEFLOW,OPENFOAM,The cubeflow dataset is an OpenFOAM simulation case used for testing,13\n182,UG_NODES,CUBEFLOW,Cubeflow provides node tree examples specifically for the ug_nodes system,11\n87,CUBEFLOW,VTKXMLUNSTRUCTUREDGRIDREADER,\"vtkXMLUnstructuredGridReader can be used to read .vtu files, though cubeflow uses OpenFOAM format; included as a relevant reader type mentioned in context\",10\n181,JSON_IMPORTEXPORT,CUBEFLOW,Cubeflow node tree examples are accessible in the json_importexport tab for import/export purposes,10\n67,VTPOPENFOAMREADER,TIME SELECTOR,vtkOpenFOAMReader outputs data to the Time Selector as its input,7\n104,CUBEFLOW_BOUNDARY_PATCH,OPENFOAM,The cubeflow_boundary_patch example processes an OpenFOAM case to extract a boundary patch,7\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
