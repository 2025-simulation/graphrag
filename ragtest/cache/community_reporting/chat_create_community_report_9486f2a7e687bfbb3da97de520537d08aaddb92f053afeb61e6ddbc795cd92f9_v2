This filter processes input polygonal datasets and partitions them based on the defined implicit function, allowing users to selectively retain either the portion of the data that lies inside or outside the clipping region. The behavior of the clipping operation can be controlled through various parameters, including options to specify whether the output should consist of the inside or outside portion relative to the clip function. Additionally, vtkClipPolyData supports the generation of scalar values during the clipping process, which can be useful for further visualization or analysis tasks. By leveraging implicit functions—mathematical representations that define surfaces such as planes, spheres, or cylinders—vtkClipPolyData provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for interactively or programmatically sectioning complex polygonal geometries within the VTK pipeline.\",4\n36,VTKSPHERESOURCE,\"vtkSphereSource is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) source object or node that generates polygonal spherical geometry with configurable properties. It allows users to define key parameters such as the sphere’s center coordinates, radius, and resolution, which controls the level of tessellation or detail in the resulting mesh. By adjusting the resolution parameters—typically including both theta and phi resolution values—the user can control how finely the sphere is subdivided, thereby influencing the smoothness and polygon count of the output geometry. As a fundamental geometry source in VTK, vtkSphereSource is commonly used in visualization pipelines to create spherical primitives for rendering, simulation, or further geometric processing. All descriptions consistently identify it as a VTK node or source object that produces a sphere with customizable center, radius, and resolution, confirming its role as a versatile and widely used component in scientific visualization workflows.\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n56,VTKCLIPPOLYDATA,VTKPLANE,vtkPlane defines the clipping function used by vtkClipPolyData to perform the clipping operation,12\n55,VTKSPHERESOURCE,VTKCLIPPOLYDATA,\"vtkSphereSource and vtkClipPolyData are two interconnected components commonly used in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline for 3D geometric processing. Specifically, vtkSphereSource is responsible for generating polygonal sphere geometry, which serves as the primary input to the vtkClipPolyData filter. vtkClipPolyData, in turn, performs clipping operations on this input geometry—typically removing portions of the sphere based on a specified clipping function, such as a plane or implicit function. The relationship between these two classes is foundational in many visualization workflows where a spherical object must be selectively cut or sectioned to reveal internal structures or to create complex composite shapes. vtkSphereSource supplies the initial, complete spherical mesh, and vtkClipPolyData modifies that mesh by retaining only the portion that satisfies the clipping criteria. This pipeline arrangement demonstrates a typical VTK pattern where a source object (vtkSphereSource) produces data that is subsequently processed by a filter (vtkClipPolyData) to achieve the desired geometric transformation. Together, they enable flexible and efficient manipulation of 3D spherical data within scientific visualization applications.\",6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
