This filter operates on datasets—often mesh-based—and allows users to designate a particular data array (e.g., an array named 'U') as the active attribute for downstream operations, such as glyph orientation. It is commonly employed to ensure that visualization modules correctly interpret which array should be treated as a vector field, scalar field, or other attribute type.\n\nThe node is configurable via properties such as the object name, enabling users to specify which input array should be reassigned or promoted. It can both assign new attributes and rename or reclassify existing ones within dataset arrays. VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE receives input from various upstream sources, including Custom Filter nodes or Multi Block Leaf data structures, and typically feeds its output into subsequent processing nodes like vtkProbeFilter. \n\nFunctionally, VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE plays a critical role in preparing data for visualization by explicitly defining how arrays should be interpreted within the VTK pipeline. Its bl_idname is identified as VTKAssignAttributeType, aligning it with Blender’s VTK integration framework where applicable. Overall, it serves as a versatile and essential component for managing data attribute semantics in scientific visualization workflows built on the Visualization Toolkit (VTK).\",8\n33,CUSTOM FILTER,\"CUSTOM FILTER is a user-defined processing node within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline that enables users to apply custom code logic to input data. It serves as a flexible component that integrates into the VTK data processing workflow, allowing for tailored data manipulation beyond the capabilities of standard VTK filters. Specifically, the CUSTOM FILTER receives its input from the Time Selector node and subsequently passes its processed output to downstream VTK filters, namely vtkAssignAttribute and vtkThreshold. This positioning within the pipeline highlights its role in intermediate data transformation, where user-specific operations—such as data conditioning, attribute computation, or selective filtering—are executed before further attribute assignment or threshold-based visualization steps. By supporting custom logic, the CUSTOM FILTER empowers users to extend the functionality of the VTK pipeline to meet specialized analytical or visualization requirements, maintaining compatibility with standard VTK data structures and processing conventions.\",5\n38,VTKPROBEFILTER,\"VTKPROBEFILTER is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter node designed to sample or interpolate data from one dataset onto the points of another dataset. Specifically, it takes two inputs: input 0, which is the source dataset containing the field data to be sampled, and input 1, which provides the point locations where sampling occurs. This enables the transfer of both spatial and field data—such as scalar, vector, or tensor attributes—from the source dataset to the target point set.\n\nThe filter supports various data types and configurations. It can sample unstructured grid data and map it onto a structured grid, such as vtkImageData, making it particularly useful for preparing data for volumetric formats like OpenVDB. Additionally, VTKPROBEFILTER offers user-configurable options, including the ability to pass specific data arrays through the filter and to set tolerance parameters that influence how closely a sample point must align with the source data for interpolation to occur. These settings are exposed as properties in pipeline implementations—for instance, in the Cubeflow pipeline, where the node is identified by the bl_idname VTKProbeFilterType and includes properties such as m_CategoricalData and m_ComputeTolerance.\n\nWithin a typical VTK processing pipeline, VTKPROBEFILTER may receive its inputs from sources such as a VTKImageData Object Source or filters like vtkAssignAttribute, and its output can feed into downstream algorithms such as vtkMarchingCubes for isosurface extraction. This makes VTKPROBEFILTER a versatile tool for data resampling, enabling interoperability between disparate datasets and facilitating visualization or analysis workflows that require data aligned to specific spatial configurations.\n\nIn summary, VTKPROBEFILTER serves as a critical interpolation and data mapping utility in VTK-based systems, combining geometric and attribute information from separate datasets into a unified output structured according to the target point locations, with configurable behavior to suit a range of scientific and engineering applications.\",7\n61,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,\"The VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER is a specialized node within the Cubeflow pipeline designed to convert VTK (Visualization Toolkit) volume or image data into the OpenVDB (.vdb) format. This conversion enables the resulting volumetric data to be utilized in downstream applications such as advanced volumetric rendering or simulation workflows, particularly within Blender. Functioning as a sink node in the pipeline, it does not pass data further downstream but instead finalizes the processing chain by exporting the converted data to a file. The node is implemented with the Blender-specific identifier bl_idname BVTK_Node_VTKToOpenVDBExporterType and includes support for custom code through an extra parameter, allowing users to tailor its behavior to specific needs. By bridging the VTK and OpenVDB ecosystems, this exporter facilitates interoperability between scientific visualization tools that produce VTK data and creative or simulation software—like Blender—that leverage OpenVDB for efficient storage and manipulation of sparse volumetric data. Its primary role is to ensure that volumetric datasets originally represented in VTK format can be accurately and efficiently transformed into the industry-standard OpenVDB format, preserving data fidelity while enabling high-quality rendering and simulation capabilities.\",6\n1,TIME SELECTOR,\"The TIME SELECTOR is a processing node used in VTK-based data pipelines, particularly within environments that integrate VTK and Blender, such as the Cubeflow pipeline. Identified by the `bl_idname` `BVTK_Node_TimeSelectorType`, it functions as a filtering node designed to select specific time steps from time-varying simulation data. This node typically receives input from a `vtkOpenFOAMReader`, which provides time-series simulation output, and passes the selected time step(s) downstream—often to a Custom Filter or other processing modules.\n\nThe TIME SELECTOR supports configuration through a `time_index` parameter, which allows users to specify which time step to extract from the input dataset. Examples in the data indicate that this parameter can be set to specific integer values, such as 1 or 5, depending on the desired time step. In addition to `time_index`, the node may include other parameters like `custom_code`, offering extended control over its behavior within the pipeline.\n\nAs a core component in simulation post-processing workflows, the TIME SELECTOR enables users to isolate particular moments in time from dynamic datasets, facilitating focused analysis or visualization of simulation results at those instants. Its role is consistent across descriptions: it does not modify the data itself but acts as a temporal filter, extracting subsets of time-varying data based on user-defined criteria. The node is explicitly designed for compatibility with VTK data structures and is commonly employed in scientific visualization pipelines that handle computational fluid dynamics (CFD) or other time-dependent simulations, especially those originating from OpenFOAM.\n\nAll descriptions align in portraying the TIME SELECTOR as a specialized, configurable node for time-step selection, with no substantive contradictions—only variations in phrasing and contextual detail. Its integration into VTK/Blender pipelines underscores its utility in bridging simulation data with interactive or automated visualization workflows.\",3\n12,VTKTUBEFILTER,\"VTKTubeFilter (also referred to as vtkTubeFilter) is a Visualization Toolkit (VTK) filter designed to enhance 3D visualization by generating tube-like geometry around input lines or polylines. It operates on polydata containing line segments—such as those representing streamlines derived from vector fields—and transforms them into visually prominent tubular structures. This conversion is particularly useful in scientific visualization, where it helps clarify the direction, shape, and structure of complex line-based data, such as fluid flow trajectories or magnetic field lines.\n\nThe filter provides several customizable properties to control the appearance and geometry of the resulting tubes. Key parameters include the tube radius, which determines the thickness of the tube; the number of sides (or segments) around the tube’s circumference, which affects its smoothness or polygonal resolution; and capping options, which define whether the ends of the tubes are closed or open. These settings allow users to balance visual fidelity with computational efficiency based on their specific rendering needs.\n\nVTKTubeFilter is frequently employed in applications involving streamline visualization, where it converts thin, often hard-to-see line representations into robust, three-dimensional tubes that convey depth and direction more effectively. Its input typically consists of polydata with line cells, and its output is a new polydata object composed of polygonal surfaces forming the tube geometry. As a core component of the VTK pipeline, it functions as both a filter and a processing node within visualization networks, enabling seamless integration into larger data processing and rendering workflows.\n\nIn summary, VTKTubeFilter is a versatile and widely used VTK class that enhances the visual representation of linear data by wrapping it in customizable tubular geometry, making it indispensable for clear and intuitive 3D visualization of vector fields, streamlines, and other line-based datasets.\",3\n13,VTKPOLYDATANORMALS,\"vtkPolyDataNormals is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter and processing node designed to compute and, if necessary, reorient surface normals for polygonal data within a VTK-based visualization pipeline. Its primary purpose is to enhance rendering quality by ensuring accurate surface normals, which are critical for proper lighting, shading, and visual appearance in 3D graphics. This filter operates on polygonal datasets—such as those generated by surface extraction or tube filtering—and can be applied downstream in the pipeline, often after operations like tube filtering or surface generation, to refine or generate normal vectors where they are missing or improperly oriented.\n\nThe vtkPolyDataNormals module offers configurable properties that allow users to control its behavior. Key parameters include m_ComputePointNormals, which determines whether point normals should be calculated (as opposed to just cell normals), and m_FlipNormals, which enables the inversion of computed normal directions when needed—for instance, to correct inward-facing normals on closed surfaces. By computing both point and cell normals as required, the filter ensures compatibility with a wide range of rendering techniques and downstream processing steps.\n\nIn VTK workflows, vtkPolyDataNormals functions as a data processing node that receives polygonal data as input—typically from another filter such as a surface extractor or tube filter—and outputs the same geometry enriched with properly computed or reoriented normals. This makes it an essential component in pipelines where high-quality visual representation is required, such as in scientific visualization, medical imaging, or engineering simulations.\n\nAll descriptions consistently identify vtkPolyDataNormals as a VTK filter or node responsible for normal computation on polygonal data to improve rendering fidelity. While some descriptions emphasize its role post-tube filtering or its configurable properties, and others focus on its general purpose in lighting and shading, there are no substantive contradictions—only complementary details. Taken together, they confirm that vtkPolyDataNormals is a versatile and widely used module in VTK for ensuring geometric data is visually accurate and ready for advanced rendering.\",7\n37,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,\"The VTKImageData Object Source is a specialized data source node used within VTK-based visualization pipelines, particularly integrated into the Cubeflow environment for Blender. It functions as an origin point in the pipeline, generating or supplying structured, voxel-based image or volumetric data formatted as VTK image data (vtkImageData). This node is identified in Cubeflow by the bl_idname `BVTK_Node_ImageDataObjectSourceType` and may include custom code or extra parameters for tailored functionality. Its primary role is to provide structured 3D image data—commonly used for volume rendering or scientific visualization—as input for downstream processing nodes. Specifically, the data it emits can feed into filters such as `vtkProbeFilter`, enabling further analysis, interpolation, or transformation of the volumetric dataset. By delivering VTK-native image data into the visualization workflow, the VTKImageData Object Source serves as a critical bridge between raw or preprocessed volumetric information and subsequent visualization or computational stages within Blender’s node-based interface. This makes it especially valuable in applications requiring the integration of medical imaging, computational fluid dynamics outputs, or other grid-aligned 3D scalar or vector fields into a visual pipeline.\",3\n25,VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER,\"vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter designed to extract surface geometry from volumetric datasets based on region or material identifiers. It operates on input data that may include clipped or segmented volumetric representations, and it specifically isolates surface representations corresponding to boundaries between different regions or materials within the dataset. This functionality makes it particularly useful in scientific visualization workflows, especially for rendering simulation domains where distinct regions—such as different tissue types in medical imaging or material phases in engineering simulations—need to be clearly delineated. By processing the input dataset and identifying transitions between regions, vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter generates surface meshes that accurately reflect these internal boundaries, enabling clearer and more informative visual analysis. The filter is implemented as a VTK module and functions as a node within VTK’s pipeline architecture, allowing it to be integrated into larger data processing and visualization systems. Overall, vtkDataSetRegionSurfaceFilter serves as a key tool for converting complex, multi-region volumetric data into surface-based representations suitable for rendering and further geometric analysis.\",2\n34,VTKTHRESHOLD,\"VTKThreshold (also referred to as vtkThreshold or VTKTHRESHOLD) is a filtering node used within the BVTKNodes system for performing thresholding operations in Visualization Toolkit (VTK)-based data processing pipelines. It functions by extracting specific portions of a dataset based on user-defined attribute value thresholds, typically specified using parameters such as Value1 and Value2. This node operates as a VTK filter, selectively passing through only those elements of the input dataset whose associated attribute values fall within the defined threshold range.\n\nWithin the BVTKNodes architecture, VTKThreshold is implemented as a software class and is located in the file 'custom_nodes/VTKFilters.py'. It is designed to integrate seamlessly into custom VTK pipeline workflows, where it commonly receives input from a Custom Filter node and subsequently feeds its processed output into downstream nodes such as vtkBoxClipDataSet. This positioning underscores its role as an intermediary filtering step that refines datasets before further geometric or topological operations are applied.\n\nThe primary purpose of VTKThreshold is to enable users to isolate regions of interest within complex datasets—such as simulation results or scientific visualizations—by filtering based on scalar, vector, or other attribute data. Its implementation adheres to standard VTK conventions while being adapted for use in the BVTKNodes environment, which facilitates node-based visual programming with VTK components in platforms like Blender. By allowing precise control over data inclusion through threshold parameters, VTKThreshold enhances the flexibility and analytical power of VTK-based visualization pipelines.\",6\n8,VTKSTRUCTUREDGRIDREADER,\"VTKStructuredGridReader (also referred to as vtkStructuredGridReader) is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter class designed to read structured grid data from a file. It functions as a data reader node within the VTK visualization pipeline and is commonly used as an input source for various downstream components and filters. Specifically, it is capable of loading structured grid datasets that may include multiple field and scalar properties, making it suitable for a wide range of scientific and engineering visualization tasks. Once the data is read, VTKStructuredGridReader outputs it in a format compatible with other VTK filters—such as vtkStreamTracer—for further processing, analysis, or rendering. Its role as a foundational input node enables it to serve as a common starting point in visualization workflows that require structured grid data, ensuring seamless integration within complex pipelines.\",4\n60,VTKSTREAMTRACER,\"VTKSTREAMTRACER (also referred to as vtkStreamTracer or VTKStreamTracerType) is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter and software component used in scientific visualization workflows to generate streamlines from vector field data. It operates by tracing paths through vector fields based on user-defined seed points, which can be supplied via various sources such as a plane source or structured grid. Implemented as a node within a visualization pipeline—specifically defined in the module generated_nodes/gen_VTKFilters2.py—it is identified by the bl_idname VTKStreamTracerType, indicating its integration into a node-based system, likely within a Blender-based or similar visual programming environment.\n\nThe functionality of VTKSTREAMTRACER centers on streamline computation, which involves integrating the vector field along trajectories starting from seed points. This process is governed by a set of configurable parameters that control the accuracy and extent of the tracing. These include integration step size, maximum propagation distance or time, and termination criteria to limit streamline length. Additionally, the filter supports advanced features such as vorticity computation, which can provide insights into rotational characteristics of the flow field.\n\nAs a core component of VTK’s filtering infrastructure, VTKSTREAMTRACER plays a key role in visualizing complex fluid dynamics, electromagnetic fields, or any domain where vector field analysis is required. By accepting vector field data—typically defined on structured grids or other mesh types—and seed geometry as inputs, it outputs streamline geometry that can be rendered or further processed. The filter’s flexibility in handling different seed configurations and integration settings makes it suitable for both qualitative exploration and quantitative analysis in scientific computing applications.\n\nIn summary, VTKSTREAMTRACER is a versatile and configurable VTK filter designed for streamline generation in vector fields, supporting a range of input sources and integration parameters, and implemented as a node within a larger visualization framework for use in scientific and engineering visualization tasks.\",5\n122,VTCTUBEFILTER,\"vtkTubeFilter is a VTK filter that generates tubes around lines or edges in the input data, often used to visualize streamlines or outlines\",2\n0,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,\"VTKOpenFOAMReader (also referenced as vtkOpenFOAMReader or vtkOpenFoamReader) is a specialized VTK-based software component or data reader node designed to load OpenFOAM simulation data into a VTK-compatible visualization or processing pipeline.

It also provides functionality for managing data arrays, including the ability to enable all patch arrays via custom code methods like `EnableAllPatchArrays()`, and supports operations such as cell-to-point data conversion.\n\nVTKOpenFOAMReader integrates seamlessly into VTK-based data processing pipelines, where it reads native OpenFOAM simulation output and converts it into VTK data structures suitable for visualization, analysis, or further computation. Its design emphasizes flexibility and performance, allowing users to fine-tune data loading behavior based on the requirements of their specific simulation or visualization task. The component is frequently used in advanced workflows, including boundary surface extraction, and is documented as a representative example of how custom code can be incorporated into VTK reader nodes.\n\nIn summary, VTKOpenFOAMReader is a versatile and configurable reader node that bridges OpenFOAM simulation data with the VTK visualization ecosystem, offering robust support for time-varying datasets, mesh handling, and data array management within a modular pipeline architecture.\",5\n22,VTKTUBLENDERMESH.001,VTK To Blender Mesh.001 is a second mesh converter for a different visualization branch,1\n29,VTK TO BLENDER MESH.001,\"VTK TO BLENDER MESH.001 is a second instance of a conversion node within a visualization or processing pipeline that transforms VTK (Visualization Toolkit) output into a mesh format compatible with Blender, a 3D modeling and animation software. This specific instance is designed to handle a secondary data stream distinct from the primary conversion node in the pipeline. It functions as one of two sink nodes, indicating its role as a terminal point where processed data is consumed or rendered.\n\nThe input to VTK TO BLENDER MESH.001 originates from VTK-based processing filters, and multiple descriptions clarify the nature of this input. One source specifies that it processes output from vtkContourFilter.001, which typically generates isosurfaces or contour lines from volumetric data. Another description notes that it handles processed streamline data, suggesting applicability in fluid dynamics or vector field visualizations where streamlines represent flow trajectories. Additionally, it is explicitly stated that the node converts VTK polydata—specifically output from vtkPolyDataNormals—into a Blender mesh. vtkPolyDataNormals is a VTK filter that computes point and/or cell normals for polygonal data, often used to enhance rendering quality.\n\nTaken together, these descriptions indicate that VTK TO BLENDER MESH.001 is a versatile but specialized converter, capable of ingesting different types of processed VTK polydata—including contour surfaces, streamline geometries, and normal-enhanced meshes—and translating them into a format suitable for use in Blender. Its designation as the “second instance” implies the existence of a primary converter (likely named VTK TO BLENDER MESH or similar) that handles a different data stream or processing branch within the same pipeline. As a sink node, VTK TO BLENDER MESH.001 plays a critical role in bridging scientific visualization workflows in VTK with the creative and rendering capabilities of Blender, enabling further manipulation, animation, or presentation of the data in a 3D environment.\",4\n63,CUBEFLOW_OPENVDB_EXPORT,cubeflow_openvdb_export is the name of an example node tree used to demonstrate OpenVDB export and volumetric rendering in Blender using VTK data,2\n54,CUBEFLOW_BOUNDARY_PATCH,An example node tree configuration designed to extract a single boundary patch from an OpenFOAM case,2\n62,VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME,\"VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME is a specialized node designed to bridge the gap between VTK (Visualization Toolkit) volumetric data and Blender’s native volume rendering system. This node functions by directly converting VTK image data—commonly used in scientific visualization and medical imaging—into a format that is fully compatible with Blender’s volume object structure. Introduced in Blender version 3.6 and available in subsequent releases, the VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME node enables users to seamlessly import and render volumetric datasets within Blender’s 3D environment without requiring intermediate conversion steps or external tools. By doing so, it facilitates the integration of high-fidelity scientific or medical volume data into Blender’s powerful rendering and animation pipeline, making it particularly useful for researchers, visual effects artists, and educators who work with complex 3D scalar fields or tomographic data. The node preserves the spatial and intensity information inherent in VTK-formatted volumes, ensuring accurate representation when rendered using Blender’s volume shaders and lighting systems.\",4\n11,VTKSTRUCTUREDGRIDOUTLINEFILTER,\"VTKStructuredGridOutlineFilter, also referred to as vtkStructuredGridOutlineFilter, is a Visualization Toolkit (VTK) filter specifically designed to generate an outline—typically rendered as a wireframe box—around the bounds of structured grid data. This filter is commonly used in scientific visualization workflows to provide a visual reference frame that encapsulates the spatial extent of the structured grid dataset. By producing a simple geometric representation of the grid’s bounding box, VTKStructuredGridOutlineFilter aids in contextualizing the data within a 3D scene, making it easier for users to understand the spatial relationships and scale of the underlying structured grid. The outline generated by this filter does not represent the internal structure or resolution of the grid itself but rather the outermost limits of the dataset, ensuring minimal computational overhead while enhancing visual clarity. As a VTK node type, it integrates seamlessly into VTK’s pipeline architecture, accepting structured grid input and outputting polydata that describes the edges of the bounding box. This functionality is particularly useful in applications where multiple datasets are visualized together, as the outline helps distinguish individual components and prevents visual clutter. Overall, VTKStructuredGridOutlineFilter serves as a lightweight yet effective tool for outlining structured grid data in visualization systems built on the VTK framework.\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n3,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,VTKCONTOURFILTER,\"In the VTK (Visualization Toolkit) pipeline, vtkAssignAttribute and vtkContourFilter work in sequence to facilitate contour generation from input datasets. Specifically, vtkAssignAttribute serves as a preprocessing filter that modifies or assigns attribute data—such as scalars, vectors, or tensors—within a dataset, ensuring that the appropriate data arrays are designated for downstream processing. The output of vtkAssignAttribute, which includes this processed and properly configured attribute data, is then passed directly as input to vtkContourFilter. vtkContourFilter utilizes this prepared data to generate isosurfaces or isolines (contours) based on specified scalar values. Thus, vtkAssignAttribute plays a critical role in preparing the dataset so that vtkContourFilter can correctly interpret and operate on the relevant scalar field for contour extraction. This coordinated interaction ensures that the visualization pipeline accurately reflects the intended data attributes during contour generation.\",14\n39,CUSTOM FILTER,VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE,\"The CUSTOM FILTER is a data processing component whose output is specifically designed to be consumed by VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE. After the CUSTOM FILTER generates its output dataset, this data is passed directly to VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE, which is responsible for assigning specific attributes to the data. This pipeline arrangement ensures that the data produced by the CUSTOM FILTER undergoes subsequent attribute assignment as part of a structured visualization or analysis workflow. Multiple descriptions consistently indicate that the CUSTOM FILTER does not perform attribute assignment itself; instead, it relies on VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE to handle this task. Thus, the relationship between the two entities is sequential and complementary: the CUSTOM FILTER serves as a data source or transformation step, and VTKASSIGNATTRIBUTE acts on that output to define or modify data attributes such as scalars, vectors, tensors, or other field data characteristics. This design aligns with typical Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline conventions, where filters produce data and attribute assignment modules refine metadata for downstream rendering or computation.\",13\n84,VTKPROBEFILTER,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,The vtkProbeFilter output is sent to the VTK to OpenVDB Exporter for format conversion,13\n1,TIME SELECTOR,MULTI BLOCK LEAF,\"The TIME SELECTOR and MULTI BLOCK LEAF are components in a hierarchical data processing pipeline, working in tandem to extract specific subsets of time-varying, multi-block datasets. The TIME SELECTOR functions as a filtering mechanism that selects or filters data based on specific time steps or temporal criteria. It outputs this time-filtered or time-step-selected data to the MULTI BLOCK LEAF node. The primary role of the MULTI BLOCK LEAF is to process the incoming time-filtered multi-block data and extract individual blocks or leaf-level datasets from the hierarchical structure. This extraction may involve isolating specific blocks, selecting leaf nodes within the multi-block hierarchy, or retrieving datasets associated with those leaf-level components. \n\nIn essence, the TIME SELECTOR ensures that only data from relevant time steps is passed forward, while the MULTI BLOCK LEAF handles the spatial or structural decomposition of that temporally filtered data to isolate the desired block or leaf dataset. This coordinated workflow enables efficient and targeted access to subsets of complex, time-dependent multi-block data structures—commonly found in scientific simulations or large-scale data analysis—by first narrowing the temporal scope and then drilling down into the structural hierarchy to retrieve specific components. The consistent terminology across descriptions—such as “time-filtered data,” “selected time-step data,” “block extraction,” and “leaf dataset extraction”—confirms a unified operational model where temporal selection precedes structural decomposition, with the TIME SELECTOR always acting as the upstream provider and the MULTI BLOCK LEAF as the downstream extractor.\",11\n18,VTKTUBEFILTER,VTKPOLYDATANORMALS,\"VTKTubeFilter and VTKPolyDataNormals are two interconnected components in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) pipeline, commonly used together to enhance the visual quality of rendered tubular geometries. VTKTubeFilter generates a tubular representation—typically by creating a polygonal mesh around a line or curve—and its output is directly connected to the input of VTKPolyDataNormals. This connection allows the geometry produced by VTKTubeFilter to be further processed by VTKPolyDataNormals, which computes and assigns surface normals to the mesh. These normals are essential for proper lighting and shading during rendering, ensuring that the tubular structures appear smooth and visually accurate. Specifically, VTKPolyDataNormals generates consistent face and vertex normals, which are critical for achieving realistic rendering effects in 3D visualizations. Thus, the workflow typically involves VTKTubeFilter first constructing the tube geometry, which is then passed to VTKPolyDataNormals to compute the necessary normals for high-quality visualization.\",10\n47,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,VTKPROBEFILTER,\"The VTKImageData Object Source and vtkProbeFilter are components within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework that interact in a data processing pipeline, though their exact relationship requires clarification to resolve apparent contradictions in the provided descriptions.  \n\nThe majority of the descriptions consistently state that the VTKImageData Object Source serves as the source of input data—specifically as “input 0”—for the vtkProbeFilter. In this role, the VTKImageData Object Source provides structured volumetric data (in the form of vtkImageData) that the vtkProbeFilter uses as a sampling grid. The vtkProbeFilter then probes or samples another dataset (typically an unstructured grid or other geometry) at the points defined by this vtkImageData grid, interpolating values from the source dataset onto the structured grid.\n\nHowever, one description claims the opposite: that the vtkProbeFilter converts unstructured grid data into vtkImageData, which is then provided via the VTKImageData Object Source. This appears contradictory because it reverses the data flow, suggesting the VTKImageData Object Source is an output rather than an input. Upon closer inspection, this likely reflects a misunderstanding of VTK pipeline semantics. In standard VTK usage, the vtkProbeFilter requires two inputs:  \n- Input 0 (the source): a dataset to be sampled (often an unstructured grid), and  \n- Input 1 (the probe): a vtkImageData object that defines where sampling occurs.  \n\nThus, the VTKImageData Object Source typically supplies Input 1 (the probe structure), not Input 0. However, the provided descriptions uniformly refer to it as “input 0,” which may stem from a specific pipeline configuration or mislabeling. Regardless, the functional role remains that the VTKImageData Object Source provides the spatial grid used for probing. The vtkProbeFilter does not generate the VTKImageData Object Source; rather, it produces a new vtkImageData output that contains sampled values from the source dataset, interpolated onto the probe grid.\n\nIn summary, the VTKImageData Object Source supplies structured grid data that defines the sampling locations for the vtkProbeFilter. The vtkProbeFilter uses this grid to sample values from another dataset (e.g., an unstructured grid) and outputs a new vtkImageData object containing the interpolated results. While one description inaccurately suggests the VTKImageData Object Source receives data from the vtkProbeFilter, the consistent and technically accurate interpretation is that it acts as an input—specifically the probe grid—to the vtkProbeFilter.\",10\n28,VTKDATASETREGIONSURFACEFILTER,VTKPOLYDATANORMALS,The surface filter outputs polygonal surface data to vtkPolyDataNormals for normal computation,9\n42,VTKTHRESHOLD,VTKBOXCLIPDATASET,vtkThreshold outputs filtered data to vtkBoxClipDataSet for spatial clipping,9\n68,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,VTKImageData Object Source supplies the structured data required by VTK To OpenVDB Exporter for .vdb conversion,9\n185,VTKSTRUCTUREDGRIDREADER,VTKSTREAMTRACER,VTKStructuredGridReader provides the primary vector field input (input 0) to vtkStreamTracer,9\n204,VTCTUBEFILTER,VTKPOLYDATANORMALS,vtkTubeFilter’s output is passed to vtkPolyDataNormals to compute surface normals for better rendering,9\n0,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,TIME SELECTOR,\"The vtkOpenFOAMReader is a data reader component that extracts time-varying simulation data from OpenFOAM simulation outputs. This data is specifically structured to support temporal analysis and visualization workflows. The primary role of the vtkOpenFOAMReader is to serve as the initial data source in a processing pipeline, where it outputs simulation data that is directly fed into the Time Selector node. The Time Selector acts as the first subsequent processing step, receiving this input to enable users to select, filter, or isolate specific time steps from the time-varying dataset. This functionality is essential for analyzing transient simulations, as it allows users to focus on particular moments in the simulation timeline without loading or processing unnecessary data. Across all descriptions, there is consistent agreement that the vtkOpenFOAMReader provides input to the Time Selector exclusively for the purpose of time-step selection or filtering, and that this connection represents the first stage in the data processing pipeline. No contradictions exist among the provided descriptions; rather, they collectively reinforce a coherent workflow in which the vtkOpenFOAMReader and Time Selector operate in sequence to manage and refine time-dependent simulation data for downstream visualization or analysis tasks.\",8\n19,VTKPOLYDATANORMALS,VTKTUBLENDERMESH.001,VTKPolyDataNormals output is used by VTK To Blender Mesh.001,8\n37,VTKCLIPPOLYDATA,VTK TO BLENDER MESH.001,\"VTKCLIPPOLYDATA (vtkClipPolyData) is a VTK filter that clips polygonal data using an implicit function or a scalar value, producing one or more output datasets based on the clipping operation. In this specific context, vtkClipPolyData is configured to generate a second output stream—typically representing the portion of the input geometry that has been clipped away—and routes this secondary output to the node or component named \"\"VTK To Blender Mesh.001.\"\" This second output is distinct from the primary clipped result and contains the complementary geometry excluded by the clipping operation. The \"\"VTK To Blender Mesh.001\"\" component then receives this clipped-away data and converts it into a mesh compatible with Blender, enabling further manipulation or visualization within the Blender environment. Thus, the workflow leverages vtkClipPolyData’s ability to output both the retained and removed portions of the geometry, with the latter being specifically channeled to \"\"VTK To Blender Mesh.001\"\" for transformation into a Blender-native mesh format. This setup facilitates advanced geometry processing pipelines where both sides of a clipping operation are preserved and utilized downstream.\",8\n67,VTKSTREAMTRACER,VTKTUBEFILTER,\"VTKSTREAMTRACER and VTKTUBEFILTER are two closely integrated components in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) used for visualizing vector field data. VTKSTREAMTRACER generates streamlines by integrating through a vector field, effectively tracing the path that a massless particle would follow within the field. These streamlines represent the direction and flow of the underlying vector data. The output of VTKSTREAMTRACER is then typically passed as input to VTKTUBEFILTER, which transforms the streamline polylines into tubular geometry. This process enhances the visual representation by giving the streamlines a three-dimensional, volumetric appearance—making them more visible and easier to interpret in rendered scenes. The resulting tubular streamlines are commonly used in scientific visualization to depict flow patterns in applications such as fluid dynamics, meteorology, and biomedical imaging. In summary, VTKSTREAMTRACER produces the streamline data, and VTKTUBEFILTER renders this data as visible, tube-like structures, forming a standard pipeline for streamline-based visualization in VTK.\",8\n70,VTK TO OPENVDB EXPORTER,CUBEFLOW_OPENVDB_EXPORT,The cubeflow_openvdb_export node tree includes and demonstrates the use of VTK To OpenVDB Exporter,8\n56,VTKOPENFOAMREADER,CUBEFLOW_BOUNDARY_PATCH,The cubeflow_boundary_patch example uses vtkOpenFOAMReader with custom code to enable patch array extraction,7\n71,VTK TO BLENDER VOLUME,VTKIMAGEDATA OBJECT SOURCE,VTKImageData Object Source provides voxel data directly to VTK To Blender Volume for volumetric rendering in Blender 3.6+,7\n16,VTKSTRUCTUREDGRIDOUTLINEFILTER,VTKTUBEFILTER,VTKStructuredGridOutlineFilter output is input to VTKTubeFilter,6\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
