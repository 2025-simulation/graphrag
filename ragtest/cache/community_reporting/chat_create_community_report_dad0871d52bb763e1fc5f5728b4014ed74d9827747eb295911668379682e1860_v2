Specifically, it includes implementations or node definitions for key implicit geometric primitives used in VTK-based visualization and computational geometry workflows. Among the classes defined in this module are vtkSphere, vtkSpheres, and vtkSuperquadric—each representing distinct types of implicit functions that can be used to model or query geometric shapes within a 3D space. vtkSphere defines a single spherical implicit function, vtkSpheres supports a collection of spheres (often used for point-based implicit modeling), and vtkSuperquadric provides a more generalized and parameterized implicit surface capable of representing a variety of rounded or box-like forms through exponent parameters.
