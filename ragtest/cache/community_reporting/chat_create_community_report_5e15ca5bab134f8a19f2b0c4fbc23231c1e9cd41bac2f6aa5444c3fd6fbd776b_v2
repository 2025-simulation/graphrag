This node serves as one of the final output components in a VTK processing pipeline, converting VTK-formatted data into native Blender mesh geometry suitable for 3D rendering, modeling, and visualization. It replaces an earlier node, \"\"VTK To Blender,\"\" offering improved mesh conversion capabilities. The node is identified by the Blender internal identifier (bl_idname) BVTK_Node_VTKToBlenderMeshType. It includes a configurable name property, allowing users to define the name of the resulting mesh object in Blender. Additionally, to properly display color information from the original VTK data, the \"\"Generate Material\"\" option must be enabled. The node can extract all boundary surfaces from VTK datasets and supports material and smoothing options for enhanced visual fidelity. Functionally, it acts as a bridge between scientific visualization data in VTK format and Blender’s 3D graphics environment, enabling seamless integration of simulation or analytical results into creative or engineering workflows.\",12\n53,VTK TO BLENDER,\"VTK TO BLENDER refers to a legacy node originally developed for Blender that was designed to convert VTK (Visualization Toolkit) surface mesh data into a format compatible with Blender's native mesh system. This node served as an early solution for users seeking to import scientific or engineering visualization data—commonly generated in VTK format—into Blender for rendering, animation, or further processing. The node specifically handled surface mesh representations from VTK files and translated them into Blender mesh objects, enabling integration of simulation results or 3D scan data into Blender workflows. However, this original implementation has since been superseded by a newer and more refined node called “VTK To Blender Mesh,” which likely offers improved functionality, performance, or compatibility. As a result, the legacy “VTK TO BLENDER” node is no longer the recommended tool for such data conversion tasks within Blender, though it may still be referenced in older projects or documentation. The evolution from “VTK TO BLENDER” to “VTK To Blender Mesh” reflects ongoing efforts to enhance interoperability between scientific visualization tools and 3D content creation software like Blender.\",2\n9,VTKPLANE,\"VTKPlane (also referred to as vtkPlane) is a VTK class and implicit function used to define an infinite plane in 3D space, primarily for slicing, clipping, or cutting operations within VTK-based visualization pipelines. It is implemented in the file custom_nodes/VTKOthers.py as a specialized node type and serves as a geometric representation of a plane through two key parameters: a normal vector and an origin point. This plane definition enables its use as an implicit function—meaning it can compute signed distances from any point in space to the plane—which is essential for operations like dataset slicing or volumetric clipping.\n\nThe VTKPlane node is commonly employed as input to the vtkCutter filter, where it acts as a cutting function to extract cross-sectional geometry from 3D datasets such as meshes or volumetric grids. Its role as an implicit function allows it to interact seamlessly with other VTK filters that require planar constraints or spatial queries. The plane is mathematically defined by the equation **n · (x − o) = 0**, where **n** is the normal vector, **o** is the origin point, and **x** is any point on the plane.\n\nIn practical applications, particularly within integrated environments like Blender with VTK extensions, VTKPlane can be configured either through direct manual input of the normal and origin values or by linking to external objects (e.g., Blender empties or transform nodes) to dynamically control the plane’s position and orientation. This flexibility makes it a versatile tool for interactive visualization and analysis workflows.\n\nOverall, VTKPlane is a foundational geometric utility in VTK pipelines, enabling precise and efficient planar operations on 3D data through its simple yet powerful parameterization via origin and normal vector.\",4\n28,VTKCLIPPOLYDATA,\"vtkClipPolyData is a filter node within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) designed to clip polygonal data using a specified clip function—most commonly a plane. This node enables users to selectively retain either the portion of the geometry that lies inside or outside the defined clipping region, offering control over which part of the dataset is preserved in the output. Additionally, vtkClipPolyData provides options for generating scalar values that indicate the clipping status of each point or cell, which can be useful for further processing or visualization tasks. By combining geometric clipping capabilities with flexible output controls and scalar generation, vtkClipPolyData serves as a versatile tool for manipulating and refining polygonal datasets in VTK-based visualization pipelines.\",4\n27,VTKSPHERESOURCE,\"vtkSphereSource is a VTK (Visualization Toolkit) source object used to generate polygonal spheres with customizable geometric properties. It functions as a node within the VTK pipeline and is specifically designed to produce spherical geometry that can be further processed or rendered in visualization applications. The primary configurable parameters of vtkSphereSource include the center coordinates, which define the sphere’s position in 3D space; the radius, which determines its size; and the resolution parameters, which control the level of detail or tessellation of the resulting polygonal mesh. Higher resolution values yield smoother and more finely subdivided spheres, while lower values produce coarser, more faceted representations. As a source object, vtkSphereSource outputs polygonal data (typically in the form of vtkPolyData), making it compatible with a wide range of VTK filters, mappers, and rendering components. Its consistent role across descriptions—as a configurable, procedural geometry generator for spheres—underscores its utility in scientific visualization, computer graphics, and simulation workflows where quick and parametric generation of spherical shapes is required.\",1\n52,VTKGEOMETRYFILTER,\"VTKGEOMETRYFILTER is a legacy VTK (Visualization Toolkit) filter node primarily used to extract geometric representations from volumetric or complex datasets. It serves as a preprocessing step, typically placed before the legacy “VTK To Blender” node in data conversion pipelines, to ensure that the geometry is in a suitable format for downstream applications such as Blender. Specifically, vtkGeometryFilter generates boundary faces—commonly triangular or quadrilateral (trigonal or quadrigonal) surface elements—from input datasets, which may include structured grids, unstructured grids, or other VTK data types. These extracted surface elements are compatible with direct conversion workflows into Blender, facilitating visualization or further manipulation in 3D modeling environments. As a legacy component, VTKGEOMETRYFILTER reflects older practices within VTK-based processing chains but remains relevant in contexts where compatibility with established pipelines or specific geometric extraction behavior is required.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n54,VTK TO BLENDER MESH,TKESKITA/BVTKNODES,\"The VTK To Blender Mesh node is a component of the tkeskita/bvtknodes GitHub repository.

Specifically, the VTK To Blender Mesh node serves to convert VTK mesh data structures into native Blender mesh objects, enabling users to leverage VTK's powerful scientific visualization and data processing capabilities within Blender's modeling and rendering environment. By integrating VTK data directly into Blender’s geometry system, this node supports workflows in scientific visualization, engineering simulation post-processing, and other domains where complex 3D data needs to be visualized or further manipulated in a creative or analytical 3D space.

Specifically, VTKPlane provides the CutFunction input to VTKCutter, defining the mathematical representation of an infinite plane in 3D space. This plane acts as the cutting function that VTKCutter uses to intersect and slice through the input dataset—such as polydata, structured grids, or unstructured grids—producing a new output that represents the intersection geometry. In essence, VTKCutter relies on VTKPlane (or another implicit function) to determine where and how to cut the input data, and VTKPlane’s role is to supply the necessary geometric parameters—namely a point on the plane and its normal vector—that fully specify the cutting surface. Together, these two classes enable users to extract cross-sectional views or contours from volumetric or surface data by applying planar slices, which is a common operation in scientific visualization and medical imaging applications.\",12\n35,VTKCLIPPOLYDATA,VTKPLANE,vtkPlane defines the clipping function used by vtkClipPolyData to perform the clipping operation,8\n34,VTKSPHERESOURCE,VTKCLIPPOLYDATA,\"vtkSphereSource and vtkClipPolyData are two interconnected components commonly used in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) for 3D graphics and data processing. Specifically, vtkSphereSource generates polygonal geometry representing a sphere, which serves as the input data for the vtkClipPolyData filter. The primary role of vtkSphereSource is to create a spherical mesh composed of polygons, which can be parameterized by properties such as radius, center position, and resolution (i.e., the number of latitude and longitude divisions). This polygonal sphere is then passed to vtkClipPolyData, a filter designed to clip or cut away portions of the input geometry based on a specified implicit function or plane. In this context, vtkSphereSource provides the initial geometric structure that vtkClipPolyData operates on during clipping operations. Together, these two classes enable users to generate a spherical object and selectively remove parts of it—useful in applications such as visualizing cross-sections, creating hollowed-out geometries, or preparing models for further simulation or rendering tasks. The relationship between them is sequential and functional: vtkSphereSource acts as the data producer, while vtkClipPolyData acts as the data processor that modifies the geometry according to user-defined clipping criteria.\",5\n55,VTKGEOMETRYFILTER,VTK TO BLENDER,vtkGeometryFilter is used in conjunction with the legacy VTK To Blender node for mesh extraction,3\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
