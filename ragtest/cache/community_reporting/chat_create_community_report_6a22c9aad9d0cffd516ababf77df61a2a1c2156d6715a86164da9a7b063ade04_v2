Blender supports volumetric rendering and, starting with version 3.6, integrates OpenVDB files as Volume Objects using the Principled Volume Shader. The software is highly extensible through Python scripting and add-ons, notably BVTKNodes—an addon that enables integration with the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). Through BVTKNodes, Blender serves as a host platform for visualizing and manipulating VTK pipeline data via a node-based interface, partially integrating with Blender’s native animation and rendering systems. BVTKNodes can be tested within Blender’s Python environment using specific command-line flags to run test scripts. Multiple long-term support (LTS) and standard versions of Blender are referenced in this context, including 2.79b, 2.80+, 2.83, 2.93, 3.3, 3.6, and 4.2, demonstrating its evolving compatibility with scientific visualization workflows.
