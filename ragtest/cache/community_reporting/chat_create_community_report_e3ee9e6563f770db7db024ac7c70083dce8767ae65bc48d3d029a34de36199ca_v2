It is designed to perform advanced vector calculus operations on scientific datasets, including the computation of gradient, divergence, vorticity, and the Q-criterion. Primarily, VTKmGradient functions by calculating gradient vectors derived from scalar fields in a dataset, enabling users to analyze spatial rates of change and other differential properties of the underlying data. As a software component, it represents a computational event that transforms input datasets by applying these mathematical operations efficiently, leveraging the performance-oriented architecture of VTK-m, which is optimized for modern, multi-core, and many-core computing environments. This makes VTKmGradient particularly useful in scientific visualization and simulation workflows where high-performance computation of field derivatives is required.\",3\n764,VTKMFILTERS1.PY,\"A software module file named 'gen_VTKFilters1.py' that contains multiple VTK-m based computational filter classes such as vtkmGradient, vtkmHistogram, and others\",12\n774,VTKMPOINTELEVATIONTYPE,\"VTKMPOINTELEVATIONTYPE refers to a specific filter node type within the VTK-m framework, implemented in the file gen_VTKFilters1.py. This node is designed to compute point elevation values for datasets by utilizing user-defined high and low reference points, which serve as the basis for elevation calculations across the geometry. The filter operates within the broader context of VTK-m—a high-performance computing library for scientific visualization—and is part of a suite of computational filters that enable data transformation and analysis on both CPU and GPU architectures. In the Blender integration of VTK-m (or a similar node-based visualization system), this filter is exposed as a node with the bl_idname identifier 'VTKmPointElevationType', allowing users to incorporate elevation-based attribute generation into their data processing pipelines. The elevation computation typically involves projecting each point in the dataset onto a line defined by the high and low reference points; the relative position along this line determines the scalar elevation value assigned to that point. This functionality is especially useful in terrain modeling, fluid dynamics visualization, or any scenario where height-based coloring or analysis is required.
