It is widely used in visual effects, 3D graphics, and scientific visualization due to its ability to handle large, complex volumetric datasets with high performance and reduced memory overhead. The library enables artists and developers to work with dynamic simulations such as smoke, fire, and clouds by representing them as hierarchical, sparse grids that only store data where it is needed. OpenVDB has become a standard tool in the visual effects industry and is integrated into various software pipelines. In particular, workflows involving the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) can export volumetric data into OpenVDB grids, which are then compatible with applications like Blender for further processing, rendering, or simulation.
