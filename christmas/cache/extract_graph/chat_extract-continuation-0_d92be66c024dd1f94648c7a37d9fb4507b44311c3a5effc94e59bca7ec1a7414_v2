Mrs.\nCratchit made the gravy (ready beforehand in a little saucepan) hissing\nhot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour; Miss\nBelinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha dusted the hot plates; Bob\ntook Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table; the two young\nCratchits set chairs for everybody, not forgetting themselves, and,\nmounting guard upon their posts, crammed spoons into their mouths, lest\nthey should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped.
