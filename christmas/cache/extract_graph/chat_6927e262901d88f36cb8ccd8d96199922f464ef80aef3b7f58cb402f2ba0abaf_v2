Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants, who hurried\nup and down, and chinked the money in their pockets, and conversed in\ngroups, and looked at their watches, and trifled thoughtfully with their\ngreat gold seals, and so forth, as Scrooge had seen them often.\n\nThe Spirit stopped beside one little knot of business men. Observing\nthat the hand was pointed to them, Scrooge advanced to listen to their\ntalk.\n\n'No,' said a great fat man with a monstrous chin, 'I don't know much\nabout it either way. I only know he's dead.'\n\n'When did he die?' inquired another.\n\n'Last night, I believe.'\n\n'Why, what was the matter with him?' asked a third, taking a vast\nquantity of snuff out of a very large snuff-box. 'I thought he'd never\ndie.'\n\n'God knows,' said the first, with a yawn.\n\n'What has he done with his money?' asked a red-faced gentleman with a\npendulous excrescence on the end of his nose, that shook like the gills\nof a turkey-cock.\n\n'I haven't heard,' said the man with the large chin, yawning again.\n'Left it to his company, perhaps. He hasn't left it to _me_. That's all\nI know.'\n\nThis pleasantry was received with a general laugh.\n\n'It's likely to be a very cheap funeral,' said the same speaker; 'for,\nupon my life, I don't know of anybody to go to it. Suppose we make up a\nparty, and volunteer?'\n\n'I don't mind going if a lunch is provided,' observed the gentleman with\nthe excrescence on his nose. 'But I must be fed if I make one.'\n\nAnother laugh.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n  _\"How are you?\" said one.\n   \"How are you?\" returned the other.\n   \"Well!\" said the first. \"Old Scratch has got his own at last, hey?\"_\n\n]\n\n'Well, I am the most disinterested among you, after all,' said the first\nspeaker, 'for I never wear black gloves, and I never eat lunch.
