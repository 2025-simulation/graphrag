But this the Spirit said could not be done.\n\n'Here is a new game,' said Scrooge. 'One half-hour, Spirit, only one!'\n\nIt was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's nephew had to think of\nsomething, and the rest must find out what, he only answering to their\nquestions yes or no, as the case was. The brisk fire of questioning to\nwhich he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an\nanimal, a live animal, rather a disagreeable animal, a savage animal, an\nanimal that growled and grunted sometimes, and talked sometimes and\nlived in London, and walked about the streets, and wasn't made a show\nof, and wasn't led by anybody, and didn't live in a menagerie, and was\nnever killed in a market, and was not a horse, or an ass, or a cow, or a\nbull, or a tiger, or a dog, or a pig, or a cat, or a bear. At every\nfresh question that was put to him, this nephew burst into a fresh roar\nof laughter; and was so inexpressibly tickled, that he was obliged to\nget up off the sofa and stamp. At last the plump sister, falling into a\nsimilar state, cried out:\n\n'I have found it out! I know what it is, Fred! I know what it is!'\n\n'What is it?' cried Fred.\n\n'It's your uncle Scro-o-o-o-oge.'\n\nWhich it certainly was. Admiration was the universal sentiment, though\nsome objected that the reply to 'Is it a bear?' ought to have been\n'Yes'; inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have\ndiverted their thoughts from Mr. Scrooge, supposing they had ever had\nany tendency that way.\n\n'He has given us plenty of merriment, I am sure,' said Fred, 'and it\nwould be ungrateful not to drink his health.
