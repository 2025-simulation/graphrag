And\nevery man on board, waking or sleeping, good or bad, had had a kinder\nword for one another on that day than on any day in the year; and had\nshared to some extent in its festivities; and had remembered those he\ncared for at a distance, and had known that they delighted to remember\nhim.\n\nIt was a great surprise to Scrooge, while listening to the moaning of\nthe wind, and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the\nlonely darkness over an unknown abyss, whose depths were secrets as\nprofound as death: it was a great surprise to Scrooge, while thus\nengaged, to hear a hearty laugh. It was a much greater surprise to\nScrooge to recognise it as his own nephew's and to find himself in a\nbright, dry, gleaming room, with the Spirit standing smiling by his\nside, and looking at that same nephew with approving affability!\n\n'Ha, ha!' laughed Scrooge's nephew. 'Ha, ha, ha!'\n\nIf you should happen, by any unlikely chance, to know a man more blessed\nin a laugh than Scrooge's nephew, all I can say is, I should like to\nknow him too. Introduce him to me, and I'll cultivate his acquaintance.\n\nIt is a fair, even-handed, noble adjustment of things, that while there\nis infection in disease and sorrow, there is nothing in the world so\nirresistibly contagious as laughter and good-humour. When Scrooge's\nnephew laughed in this way--holding his sides, rolling his head, and\ntwisting his face into the most extravagant contortions--Scrooge's\nniece, by marriage, laughed as heartily as he. And their assembled\nfriends, being not a bit behindhand, roared out lustily.\n\n'Ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha!'\n\n'He said that Christmas was a humbug, as I live!' cried Scrooge's\nnephew. 'He believed it, too!'\n\n'More shame for him, Fred!' said Scrooge's niece indignantly. Bless\nthose women! they never do anything by halves. They are always in\nearnest.\n\nShe was very pretty; exceedingly pretty.
