He was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret\neyes, when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters.\nSo he listened for the hour.\n\nTo his great astonishment, the heavy bell went on from six to seven, and\nfrom seven to eight, and regularly up to twelve; then stopped. Twelve!\nIt was past two when he went to bed. The clock was wrong. An icicle must\nhave got into the works. Twelve!\n\nHe touched the spring of his repeater, to correct this most preposterous\nclock. Its rapid little pulse beat twelve, and stopped.\n\n'Why, it isn't possible,' said Scrooge, 'that I can have slept through a\nwhole day and far into another night. It isn't possible that anything\nhas happened to the sun, and this is twelve at noon!'\n\nThe idea being an alarming one, he scrambled out of bed, and groped his\nway to the window. He was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve\nof his dressing-gown before he could see anything; and could see very\nlittle then. All he could make out was, that it was still very foggy and\nextremely cold, and that there was no noise of people running to and\nfro, and making a great stir, as there unquestionably would have been if\nnight had beaten off bright day, and taken possession of the world. This\nwas a great relief, because 'Three days after sight of this First of\nExchange pay to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge or his order,' and so forth, would\nhave become a mere United States security if there were no days to count\nby.\n\nScrooge went to bed again, and thought, and thought, and thought it over\nand over, and could make nothing of it. The more he thought, the more\nperplexed he was; and, the more he endeavoured not to think, the more he\nthought.\n\nMarley's Ghost bothered him exceedingly. Every time he resolved within\nhimself, after mature inquiry that it was all a dream, his mind flew\nback again, like a strong spring released, to its first position, and\npresented the same problem to be worked all through, 'Was it a dream or\nnot?'\n\nScrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three-quarters more,\nwhen he remembered, on a sudden, that the Ghost had warned him of a\nvisitation when the bell tolled one. He resolved to lie awake until the\nhour was passed; and, considering that he could no more go to sleep than\ngo to heaven, this was, perhaps, the wisest\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "qwen3-max", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5120d9bb891a7e8aeee03b76ba6510f8cdcdb90021b7f48e9ac5a704000dd7a0_v2"}
