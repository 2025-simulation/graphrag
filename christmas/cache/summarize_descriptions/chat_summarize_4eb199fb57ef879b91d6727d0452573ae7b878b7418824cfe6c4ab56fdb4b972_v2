The counting-house serves as the central location for Scrooge’s professional activities, reflecting his role as a businessman deeply involved in managing his accounts and transactions. Within this workplace, Scrooge maintains a close watch over his sole employee, Bob Cratchit, who serves as his clerk and carries out day-to-day administrative duties under Scrooge’s supervision. The relationship between Scrooge and Cratchit within the counting-house highlights the hierarchical and often austere nature of Scrooge’s management style, as he is known for his frugality and exacting standards.
