The plump sister attended Fred’s Christmas party as a guest, where she actively participated in the festivities. During the event, she engaged directly with Fred in a game of “Yes and No,” a traditional parlor game often played during Victorian-era holiday celebrations. This interaction highlights her presence as a notable attendee and suggests a level of familiarity or sociability between her and Fred. While limited details are provided about her identity beyond her physical description and role as a guest, her participation in the game underscores her involvement in the party’s entertainment. The setting appears to be a warm, convivial Christmas celebration, consistent with the tone of classic holiday narratives.
