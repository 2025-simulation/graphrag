Martha is one of Bob’s daughters and shares a close bond with her father, as demonstrated by her playful behavior—on Christmas Day, she hides from him as a lighthearted surprise, only to reveal herself joyfully during their family celebration. During these gatherings, Martha also shares her work experiences with the family, contributing to the intimate and supportive atmosphere of the Cratchit household. The descriptions consistently affirm their parent-child relationship, with no contradictions present; all sources agree that Bob Cratchit is Martha’s father and that Martha is his daughter.
