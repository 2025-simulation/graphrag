Despite Scrooge’s famously disagreeable and miserly nature, Fred maintains unwavering compassion and goodwill toward his uncle. Each year, Fred hosts a festive Christmas party attended by his wife and friends, where he leads cheerful games and toasts to Scrooge’s health—an act of kindness that underscores his generosity of spirit even in the face of his uncle’s repeated rejections and gruff demeanor. Although Scrooge initially declines Fred’s invitations and scorns the notion of Christmas merriment, Fred never wavers in his affection or hope for reconciliation. Following Scrooge’s profound transformation after his encounters with the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come, Fred warmly welcomes his uncle to dinner, symbolizing the restoration of their familial bond. In this reformed dynamic, Scrooge not only attends Fred’s Christmas gathering but is also later shown inviting Fred to dinner himself, reflecting his newfound appreciation for family and celebration.

Her presence is marked by both humor and warmth, embodying the convivial spirit of the celebration. In the course of the party’s games, she demonstrates perceptiveness by correctly guessing that the answer to a charade or riddle is “Scrooge,” showcasing her engagement and cleverness.
