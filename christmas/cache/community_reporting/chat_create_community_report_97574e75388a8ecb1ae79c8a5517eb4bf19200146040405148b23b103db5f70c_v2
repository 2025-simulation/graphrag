Initially portrayed as a grasping, covetous, and miserly old man, Scrooge is the surviving partner of the firm Scrooge and Marley, deeply preoccupied with financial matters such as promissory notes and profit. He is skeptical, caustic, and dismissive of others, particularly during the Christmas season, which he famously derides. On Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns him that he will be haunted by three spirits—the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come—unless he changes his ways to avoid Marley’s doomed afterlife fate.\n\nThough initially incredulous and resistant to the supernatural, Scrooge is profoundly shaken by Marley’s apparition and the subsequent visions. Through the Ghost of Christmas Past, he revisits formative moments from his youth, including his time as a young apprentice under the kind and jovial Mr. Fezziwig during a joyful Christmas Eve celebration, which stirs regret for the path his life has taken. The Ghost of Christmas Present reveals the current suffering of others, notably the Cratchit family and their ailing son, Tiny Tim, whose fate hinges on compassion Scrooge has thus far withheld. Finally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows Scrooge a vision of his own neglected grave and the indifference with which his death would be met, filling him with profound remorse and fear about his potential fate.\n\nThese transformative experiences lead Scrooge to undergo a dramatic moral and emotional reformation. By Christmas morning, he emerges as a generous, kind-hearted man, embracing the spirit of the season with newfound joy and empathy. He becomes a benefactor to the Cratchit family, ensuring Tiny Tim receives the care he needs, and effectively serves as a second father to the boy. Scrooge’s redemption marks a complete departure from his former self, illustrating the power of compassion, reflection, and second chances.\",26\n276,SCROOGE'S OFFICE,\"Scrooge’s Office is the workplace of Ebenezer Scrooge, central to key moments in his transformation throughout *A Christmas Carol*. It serves as both a symbol of his former cold, miserly existence and the setting for his redemption. In one pivotal scene, Scrooge arrives unusually early to his office in an attempt to catch his clerk, Bob Cratchit, arriving late—a reflection of his earlier harsh and suspicious nature. However, after his ghostly visitations, Scrooge returns to the same office with a changed heart and surprises Bob by not only forgiving his tardiness but also announcing a significant raise in his salary, marking the beginning of his generous and compassionate new life. The office also appears in a haunting vision of the future shown to Scrooge by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. In this grim premonition, the office is occupied by a stranger, indicating Scrooge’s absence—likely due to his death—and underscoring the consequences of his unrepentant ways. This vision powerfully reinforces the urgency of his moral awakening. Thus, Scrooge’s Office functions as more than just a place of business; it is a narrative anchor that charts Scrooge’s journey from isolation and greed to empathy and renewal, embodying both the bleakness of his past and the hope of his reformed future.\",3\n106,CHRISTMAS EVE / GHOSTLY VISITATION,\"An ongoing supernatural event involving ghostly visitations to Ebenezer Scrooge, beginning with Marley's Ghost and预告 further spirits; marked by temporal confusion and the striking of bells at unusual times\",2\n17,MR. FEZZIWIG,\"Mr. Fezziwig is a kind-hearted, jovial old merchant who was Ebenezer Scrooge's former employer\",1\n22,GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY,The Ghost of Jacob Marley is the spectre of Scrooge's deceased former business partner who warns Scrooge about his fate,1\n62,CHRISTMAS EVE,\"Christmas Eve is the pivotal evening setting of Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*, serving as both a literal and symbolic backdrop for the story’s transformative events. It is the evening before Christmas Day, described in the narrative as one of the “good days in the year,” yet marked by cold, bleak, and foggy weather in the City of London. This specific Christmas Eve is the moment when Ebenezer Scrooge undergoes his profound moral awakening, prompted by visits from the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come.\n\nThroughout the story, Christmas Eve is portrayed as a time of contrasting experiences. For Scrooge’s clerk, Bob Cratchit, it is a cherished occasion: despite his modest means, he joyfully participates in seasonal merriment, even playfully sliding on the ice with other boys on his way home. At the Cratchit household, the evening is a time of familial warmth and celebration; the family gathers together, enjoys chestnuts, sings carols, and is especially delighted by the return of their daughter Martha, who has been granted a rare day off from her apprenticeship.\n\nIn contrast, the Ghost of Christmas Past transports Scrooge back to a Christmas Eve from his youth, revealing a more generous and festive era embodied by his former employer, Mr. Fezziwig. Fezziwig hosts a lively evening celebration for his apprentices and staff, filled with music, dancing, and abundant goodwill—an event that underscores the value of kindness and communal joy, values Scrooge has since abandoned.\n\nMoreover, the narrative implies that this current Christmas Eve is part of a recurring pattern: for the past seven years, Scrooge has continued to forge a metaphorical chain of greed and isolation, symbolizing his moral decline. Thus, Christmas Eve functions not only as a festive occasion for others but also as a critical juncture for Scrooge’s redemption. The evening encapsulates the novella’s central themes—compassion versus avarice, memory versus neglect, and the enduring possibility of personal change. Through its varied depictions across different households and time periods, Christmas Eve emerges as a multifaceted symbol of both celebration and reckoning within the story.\",12\n25,DICK WILKINS,\"Dick Wilkins is a character from Charles Dickens’s novella *A Christmas Carol*. He was Ebenezer Scrooge’s fellow apprentice under their jovial and generous employer, Mr. Fezziwig, during Scrooge’s youth. Described as being very attached to Scrooge, Dick Wilkins shared in the formative experiences of their apprenticeship, which included the memorable Christmas party hosted by Fezziwig—an event that later serves as a poignant reminder to Scrooge of the value of kindness, generosity, and human connection. Though Dick Wilkins appears only briefly in the story, his presence underscores the contrast between Scrooge’s happier, more sociable past and his later miserly isolation. Their shared time under Fezziwig’s mentorship highlights a period when Scrooge was capable of joy and camaraderie, with Dick representing a lost connection to that earlier, more humane version of himself.\",3\n97,MARLEY'S GHOST,,5\n275,CHURCHYARD,\"A neglected, walled-in burial ground overgrown with grass and weeds where Scrooge sees his own grave during a supernatural vision\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n18,EBENEZER SCROOGE,BOB CRATCHIT,Ebenezer Scrooge is Bob Cratchit's employer in 'A Christmas Carol',56\n529,EBENEZER SCROOGE,SCROOGE'S OFFICE,\"Scrooge’s former workplace appears in the future vision as occupied by another, indicating his absence due to death or irrelevance\",29\n151,EBENEZER SCROOGE,CHRISTMAS EVE / GHOSTLY VISITATION,\"Scrooge is the central figure experiencing the ghostly visitation event, which includes temporal anomalies and supernatural warnings\",28\n26,MR.
