Marley’s ghost appears both symbolically—on Scrooge’s door knocker—and audibly, through clanking chains and ringing bells during the Ghostly Visitation. His afterlife torment, resulting from a life of greed and emotional coldness, is presented as a cautionary mirror to Scrooge’s current behavior. This duality of memory and spectral presence underscores Marley’s function as both a narrative device and a thematic embodiment of regret and consequence.

All three participated in the formalities surrounding Marley’s burial, evidenced by their signatures on the burial register. The Clerk, despite his lowly position, fulfilled bureaucratic duties by signing the register, highlighting his dual role as both employee and civil functionary. The Undertaker provided burial services, while the Clergyman officiated or participated in the religious rites. Notably, Scrooge attended the funeral but used the occasion for business, reflecting his emotional detachment—a detail that further contrasts with the formal solemnity observed by others. This convergence of roles around Marley’s funeral illustrates the intersection of civic duty, spiritual practice, and personal indifference in Victorian society.

This moral resilience starkly contrasts with Scrooge’s miserliness and emotional frigidity, positioning Cratchit as a living embodiment of the compassion Marley now regrets lacking.

The visitation disrupts the mundane reality of Scrooge’s world and signals the start of his supernatural encounters. Its occurrence in a commercial space (the cellar of a wine merchant) juxtaposes the spiritual with the mercantile, reinforcing the story’s critique of materialism.

This rhetorical device reinforces the narrative’s insistence on the reality of Marley’s passing—confirmed by burial records and multiple witnesses—thereby legitimizing the supernatural events that follow.

This triad of professional roles—commercial, spiritual, and bureaucratic—reflects the institutional framework surrounding death in Victorian England. Their collective involvement not only authenticates Marley’s demise but also creates a web of accountability and witness that makes the subsequent ghostly return all the more unsettling, as it defies the finality their actions were meant to affirm.

His death was unequivocally confirmed, with an official burial register signed by Scrooge and others, underscoring the finality of his passing. Despite his death, Marley’s presence continues to haunt Scrooge in both memory and supernatural form. Early in the story, Scrooge is startled to see Marley’s ghostly face appear on his door knocker—visibly unchanged from life, complete with ghostly spectacles and a mournful expression—marking the beginning of a series of spectral encounters. Scrooge’s lingering association with Marley is evident in his half-expectation of seeing Marley’s distinctive pigtail, revealing the deep imprint his former partner has left on his psyche. Their shared history is characterized by austerity and coldness, as referenced in recollections of past winters and the state of the hearth, symbolizing the emotional and moral frigidity that defined their partnership. Marley’s ghost later returns in full form to warn Scrooge of the consequences of his miserly ways, revealing the torment he endures in the afterlife due to his uncharitable life. Thus, Jacob Marley serves not only as a spectral omen but also as a mirror of Scrooge’s potential fate, embodying the themes of regret, redemption, and the inescapable consequences of one’s earthly actions.\",9\n60,CLERGYMAN,,2\n96,GHOSTLY VISITATION,\"A supernatural event involving the ringing of bells, clanking chains, and the implied presence of Marley’s ghost, marking the beginning of Scrooge’s haunted experience\",2\n55,ST.

He earns a meager fifteen shillings a week and supports a wife and a large family, including his ailing son, Tiny Tim. Despite his difficult circumstances and Scrooge’s harsh treatment, Cratchit maintains a warm, kind-hearted, and festive spirit, especially during the Christmas season—qualities that stand in stark contrast to Scrooge’s initial coldness and miserliness. In addition to his role in Scrooge’s counting house, Cratchit also fulfills minor administrative duties outside of his regular employment; notably, he is the record-keeper who signed Jacob Marley’s burial register, indicating his involvement in bureaucratic aspects of the burial process. This dual portrayal underscores Cratchit’s position as both a devoted family man and a dutiful civil servant, embodying humility, resilience, and compassion in the face of economic hardship.
