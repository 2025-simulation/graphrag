Their situation exemplifies how rigid creditor practices—possibly emblematic of broader societal norms—can impose severe psychological and material strain on vulnerable households.

For Caroline’s family, it represents deliverance from potential ruin. Conversely, the deceased man’s body is left unattended, and his possessions are looted, suggesting a lack of communal respect or mourning. This contrast highlights the creditor’s social alienation and the conditional nature of empathy in a society shaped by economic roles. The event—referred to as 'The Death of the Miser'—is thus both a moment of liberation for debtors and a symbol of moral decay surrounding greed and isolation.
