She is depicted as the devoted wife of another man and the caring mother of several children, embodying the domestic happiness and emotional richness that Scrooge forfeited in his pursuit of money. Though no longer romantically involved with Scrooge, Belle remains an old friend of his, and her presence—particularly in the visions shown by the Ghost of Christmas Past—serves as a poignant reminder of the life and love Scrooge might have had if he had chosen a different path.

However, his perspective shifts dramatically through a supernatural journey that occurs on Christmas Eve—an experience orchestrated by the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, and three subsequent spirits: the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. This otherworldly visitation serves as the pivotal event that compels Scrooge to reflect deeply on his past actions, present behavior, and potential future. As he witnesses key moments from his life and glimpses the consequences of his selfishness—including the suffering of those around him, such as his underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit and Cratchit’s ailing son, Tiny Tim—Scrooge is gradually overwhelmed by remorse and empathy. The joy, warmth, and kindness intrinsically linked to Christmas, which he once ridiculed, ultimately move him to tears and inspire a heartfelt change of character. By the story’s conclusion, Scrooge embraces the true spirit of Christmas, embodying generosity, compassion, and goodwill toward others.
