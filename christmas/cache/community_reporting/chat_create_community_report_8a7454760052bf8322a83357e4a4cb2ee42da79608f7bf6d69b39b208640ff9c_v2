The novella centers on the moral transformation of its protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge, during the Christmas season, as he is visited by the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come. Through these supernatural encounters, Scrooge confronts his past actions, witnesses the joy and hardship of those around him in the present, and glimpses a grim future should he fail to change his ways. This narrative event ultimately leads to his redemption and embrace of generosity, compassion, and the spirit of Christmas.\n\nThe work has been widely reproduced and adapted since its initial publication. Notably, it was illustrated by Arthur Rackham and republished in 1915, adding a distinctive visual dimension to Dickens’s story. Additionally, *A Christmas Carol* is available as a Project Gutenberg eBook, which was released on December 24, 2007, making the text freely accessible to a global digital audience. These various editions and formats underscore the enduring cultural and literary significance of Dickens’s tale, which continues to resonate with readers more than 180 years after its first appearance.
