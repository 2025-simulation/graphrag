His role in *A Christmas Carol* is pivotal: he appears to Ebenezer Scrooge to warn him of the consequences of a life devoid of compassion and to announce the arrival of three spirits who will guide Scrooge toward redemption. Marley’s spectral existence embodies the moral consequences of unethical business practices and personal indifference to human suffering.

Though the entity 'WISE MEN' lacks a detailed description and has a low degree (1), its inclusion highlights a key thematic tension in the narrative: the choice between selfishness and compassion.
