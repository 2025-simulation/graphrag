This functionality is essential for enabling proper lighting and rendering in 3D visualizations, ensuring that geometric models appear visually accurate and realistic. As a processing node with a degree of 3, it likely connects to multiple upstream or downstream components in a larger pipeline, though only one relationship is documented in the provided data.

With a degree of 1, it appears to be a terminal or observational node in the pipeline, used primarily for debugging, logging, or user feedback rather than active data transformation. Its low connectivity suggests it is not a central processing hub but rather a utility node for monitoring pipeline behavior.

This indicates a unidirectional data flow typical of visualization pipelines, where computational results are passed to diagnostic or display components. The combined degree of this relationship is 4, reflecting the sum of the degrees of the two connected entities (3 + 1), which underscores that VTKPolyDataNormals is more central to the broader network than the Info node.
