VTKPolyDataReader reads VTK-formatted polygonal data and feeds it into the TIME SELECTOR, which filters specific time steps.

This capability is essential in scientific visualization workflows where only certain temporal slices of simulation or experimental data are needed for analysis or rendering.

As the initial node, it converts raw file data into a structured in-memory representation suitable for subsequent processing stages. Its role is critical, as any issues with file parsing or format compatibility at this stage would propagate through the entire pipeline.
