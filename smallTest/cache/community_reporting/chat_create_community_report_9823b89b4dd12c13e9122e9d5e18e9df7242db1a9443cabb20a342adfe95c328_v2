Zheng has authored or co-authored multiple technical documents that explain the functionality and application of specific VTK nodes within this pipeline. These include detailed guides on the VTKConeSource node, which generates cone geometry, and the VTKElevationFilter node, which applies elevation-based rendering references to mesh data—often used to enhance visual depth or encode scalar values via height. Zheng also documented the VTKSphereSource node, outlining its parameters for generating spherical geometry in visualization workflows.\n\nIn addition, Kazure Zheng created documentation for color mapping and gradient tools essential to data visualization in this environment. This includes the “颜色映射 COLOR MAPPER” document, which explains the BVTK_Node_ColorMapperType node used to map scalar data to colors, and the “颜色渐变 COLOR RAMP” guide, which describes how to define and apply color gradients for visual representation. Furthermore, Zheng contributed an overview titled “JSON 文件的格式概述” (Overview of JSON File Format), which details the structure of JSON files used to store and process workflow data, including nodes and their interconnections within the VTK-Blender system.\n\nCollectively, Zheng’s work demonstrates a deep engagement with the technical bridge between VTK’s scientific visualization capabilities and Blender’s 3D modeling environment. The documentation consistently focuses on enabling users to convert, manipulate, and render mesh data through a node-based interface, facilitating tasks such as geometry generation, elevation-based shading, and color mapping.
