It functions as a software component or node within a visualization pipeline, applying colors based on instructions received from a Color Ramp node or similar control mechanisms. To operate effectively, COLOR MAPPER requires scalar input data; without such data, it cannot generate or apply color mappings. The node utilizes various configurable parameters—such as auto_range, color_by, and lookup tables—to determine how scalar values are translated into visual color representations. These parameters enable users to define the range of scalar values to be mapped, select the attribute or field to color by, and choose or customize the color gradient or palette used in the visualization. By transforming numerical or categorical scalar data into intuitive color gradients, COLOR MAPPER enhances the interpretability and visual clarity of complex geometric models, making it an essential tool in scientific visualization and data-driven rendering workflows.\",4\n8,VTK ELEVATION FILTER,\"The VTK Elevation Filter, formally known as vtkElevationFilter, is a data processing filter within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework. Its primary function is to generate scalar values based on the spatial elevation of points in a dataset. These scalar values are typically normalized to a range between 0.0 and 1.0, making them well-suited for use as input to color mapping operations in visualization pipelines. By assigning scalar data derived from geometric elevation—often computed along a specified axis or between two user-defined endpoints—the filter enables intuitive visual representation of three-dimensional structures through color gradients or other scalar-dependent rendering techniques. This capability is particularly useful in scientific visualization, where highlighting variations in height or depth across a surface or volume can reveal important structural or topographical features. As part of VTK’s extensive suite of data transformation and visualization tools, vtkElevationFilter serves as a foundational component for preparing geometric data for enhanced visual analysis.\",3\n11,P_ELEVATION,,2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n16,COLOR MAPPER,COLOR RAMP,The Color Mapper uses the Color Ramp as its lookup table (LUT) to map scalar values to colors,9\n14,VTK ELEVATION FILTER,COLOR MAPPER,\"The vtkElevationFilter generates scalar data (e.g., 'P_Elevation') that the Color Mapper uses for coloring geometry\",7\n15,VTK ELEVATION FILTER,P_ELEVATION,vtkElevationFilter produces the scalar array named P_Elevation,5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
