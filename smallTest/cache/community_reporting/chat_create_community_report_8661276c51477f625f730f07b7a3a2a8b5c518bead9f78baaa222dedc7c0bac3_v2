Specifically, it computes elevation-derived scalar data—often labeled as 'P_Elevation'—for each vertex in the input geometry. These scalar values are primarily used to enable color mapping and enhance visual interpretation in VTK-based visualization pipelines. By assigning a scalar value proportional to the height (or elevation) of each point relative to a user-defined axis or direction, the filter facilitates the representation of terrain-like features or other elevation-dependent phenomena. As a VTK filter node, VTKELEVATIONFILTER operates on polygonal or unstructured grid data and integrates seamlessly into VTK’s modular architecture, allowing downstream visualization components—such as mappers and actors—to render color-coded representations based on the computed elevation scalars. This functionality is especially useful in scientific visualization, geographic information systems (GIS), and any application where spatial height conveys meaningful information.\",4\n2,VTKELEVATIONFILTERTYPE,\"VTKElevationFilterType is the specific node type referenced in the document that implements elevation-based scalar generation in a visualization graph\nVTKElevationFilterType is a node type in a visualization framework (likely based on VTK – Visualization Toolkit) that adds scalar data to geometric vertices based on their position along a specified axis defined by low and high points\",2\n3,VTKCONESOURCE,\"vtkConeSource is a data source class within the Visualization Toolkit (VTK) framework, designed to generate three-dimensional cone-shaped geometric mesh data. It functions as a geometric source node that produces basic cone geometry without associated scalar values or data attributes, focusing solely on the structural representation of the cone. The generated output is typically used in visualization pipelines for rendering or further geometric processing.\n\nThe cone created by vtkConeSource is highly configurable through a set of parameters that allow precise control over its shape and orientation. Key parameters include the cone’s height, base radius, and center point in 3D space. Additionally, users can specify the direction vector along which the cone’s axis is aligned, enabling placement and orientation flexibility within a scene. The class also supports configuration of the cone’s resolution, which determines the number of facets or subdivisions around the cone’s circumference, thereby affecting the smoothness of the rendered surface. Another important option is capping, which controls whether the base of the cone is closed with a planar surface or left open.\n\nAs part of VTK’s suite of implicit geometric sources, vtkConeSource serves as a foundational tool for creating simple yet versatile 3D primitives in scientific visualization, computer graphics, and simulation applications. Its output consists purely of polygonal mesh data—vertices, edges, and faces—without embedded scalar, vector, or texture data, making it suitable for scenarios where only geometry is required or where additional data will be added in subsequent pipeline stages. The class is commonly used in conjunction with other VTK filters and mappers to build complex visualizations from basic shapes.\n\nIn summary, vtkConeSource is a core geometric data source in the Visualization Toolkit that enables the programmatic generation of customizable, uncapped or capped, cone-shaped 3D meshes with configurable height, radius, direction, center, resolution, and capping behavior, serving as a building block for visualization and geometric modeling tasks.\",1\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n5,VTKELEVATIONFILTER,COLOR MAPPER,\"vtkElevationFilter generates the scalar data required by the Color Mapper node to perform color-based visualization\nvtkElevationFilter supplies the scalar data required by the Color Mapper to enable color-based rendering of geometry\",8\n3,VTKELEVATIONFILTERTYPE,VTKELEVATIONFILTER,\"VTKElevationFilterType is the node implementation that encapsulates the vtkElevationFilter functionality\nVTKElevationFilterType is the node type that implements the functionality of vtkElevationFilter in the described system\",6\n4,VTKCONESOURCE,VTKELEVATIONFILTER,\"vtkElevationFilter processes geometric output from sources like vtkConeSource to add scalar data for visualization\nvtkConeSource provides geometric input (e.g., cone mesh) that vtkElevationFilter processes to add scalar elevation data\",5\n\n\nThe report should include the following sections:\n\n- TITLE: community's name that represents its key entities - title should be short but specific.
