Though misclassified as an ‘organization’ in the source data, it functions as a technical entity representing a specific module in the software architecture. It integrates geometric input with a color lookup table—likely supplied by the COLOR RAMP—to produce colorized visual outputs.

This dependency is critical for the proper functioning of the visualization pipeline, as the mapper relies on the ramp’s definition to translate numerical values into visual color representations.
