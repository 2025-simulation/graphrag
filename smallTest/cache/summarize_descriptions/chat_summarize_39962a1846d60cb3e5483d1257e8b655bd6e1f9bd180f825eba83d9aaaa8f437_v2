It functions as a software component or node within a visualization pipeline, applying colors based on instructions received from a Color Ramp node or similar control mechanisms. To operate effectively, COLOR MAPPER requires scalar input data; without such data, it cannot generate or apply color mappings. The node utilizes various configurable parameters—such as auto_range, color_by, and lookup tables—to determine how scalar values are translated into visual color representations. These parameters enable users to define the range of scalar values to be mapped, select the attribute or field to color by, and choose or customize the color gradient or palette used in the visualization. By transforming numerical or categorical scalar data into intuitive color gradients, COLOR MAPPER enhances the interpretability and visual clarity of complex geometric models, making it an essential tool in scientific visualization and data-driven rendering workflows.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1764691183, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 196, "prompt_tokens": 237, "total_tokens": 433, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
