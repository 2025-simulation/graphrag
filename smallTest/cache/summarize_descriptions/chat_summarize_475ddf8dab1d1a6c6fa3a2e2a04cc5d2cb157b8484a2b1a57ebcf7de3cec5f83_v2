As a VTK-based component, it operates within a visualization pipeline and relies on scalar input to function effectively. The node utilizes a lookup table to translate scalar values into corresponding colors, enabling intuitive visual representation of data-driven attributes across 3D models or datasets.\n\nThe COLOR MAPPER functions in coordination with other nodes in the visualization system, particularly taking instructions or parameters from the Color Ramp node, which defines how colors should be distributed across the scalar range. Key configurable parameters of the COLOR MAPPER include `auto_range`, which automatically determines the range of scalar values to map, and `color_by`, which specifies the scalar field to be used for color mapping. These settings allow users to fine-tune how data is visually encoded, supporting both automatic and manual control over the color-mapping process.\n\nBy converting abstract scalar data into a color spectrum, the COLOR MAPPER enhances the interpretability of complex datasets in scientific visualization, geographic information systems, and engineering simulations. Its integration with VTK (Visualization Toolkit) ensures compatibility with a wide range of data formats and rendering backends, making it a flexible and essential tool in data-driven visualization workflows. Overall, the COLOR MAPPER serves as a critical bridge between raw numerical data and its visual representation, enabling users to perceive patterns, gradients, and anomalies through color.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1764692954, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 304, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 542, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
