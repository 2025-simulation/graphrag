As part of the Blender-VTK integration framework, INFO serves as a processing or visualization unit that allows users to inspect, extract, and monitor information about the data flowing through the pipeline. This node is particularly useful for debugging and understanding the structure, properties, or characteristics of VTK datasets as they are processed within the node-based environment of Blender. By providing real-time access to data attributes—such as point or cell counts, data types, field arrays, or geometric bounds—INFO enhances the user’s ability to validate inputs, verify transformations, and ensure correct pipeline behavior without requiring external tools or manual data inspection. Its role is non-destructive and purely informational, making it an essential component for users developing or troubleshooting complex VTK-based visualization workflows in Blender.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1763473986, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 194, "prompt_tokens": 204, "total_tokens": 398, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
