He plays an active role in the family’s Christmas dinner preparations, contributing with enthusiasm and energy. Specifically, Master Peter assists in fetching the Christmas goose, a central element of the Cratchit family’s modest yet joyous holiday meal. In addition to this task, he is also responsible for mashing the potatoes, a chore he undertakes with notable vigor and dedication. These details highlight Master Peter’s helpful nature and his involvement in the familial warmth and collaborative spirit that characterize the Cratchit household during their Christmas celebration.
