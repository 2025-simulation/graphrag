The organization specifies that its eBooks may be freely used within the United States, particularly when those works are no longer protected by U.S. copyright law. Central to Project Gutenberg’s mission is the provision of public domain literature, and the vast majority of its collection consists of works that have entered the public domain specifically under U.S. legal standards. Consequently, the initiative’s terms of use explicitly reference U.S. copyright statutes to determine the permissible scope of distribution, reproduction, and modification of its eBooks. Within the United States, users are generally allowed nearly any use of Project Gutenberg’s eBooks—such as copying, sharing, and adapting—provided the works are not under active copyright protection according to U.S. law. This strong alignment with U.S. copyright frameworks underscores the organization’s focus on legal compliance within the United States while facilitating broad access to cultural and literary heritage.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761478107, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 195, "prompt_tokens": 231, "total_tokens": 426, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
