Its primary mission is to ensure a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg, the pioneering digital library that provides free access to public domain and licensed literary works in machine-readable form. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, the Foundation operates in compliance with U.S. charity laws across all 50 states and relies on public donations to sustain its activities. As a registered charitable organization, it accepts tax-deductible contributions from individuals and institutions.\n\nPGLAF owns the Project Gutenberg™ trademark and holds a compilation copyright in the collective body of Project Gutenberg electronic works. This legal ownership enables the Foundation to oversee the distribution and integrity of the Project Gutenberg collection while promoting free access to electronic literary works under specific licensing terms. The Foundation is responsible for managing permissions related to alternative distribution arrangements and serves as the designated recipient for any royalty payments associated with the use of Project Gutenberg materials.\n\nIn carrying out its mission, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation distributes electronic works under a legal framework that includes disclaimers of liability and limited warranties, ensuring that users understand the terms of use. It also actively encourages the expansion of freely distributable works by supporting the digitization and dissemination of texts that are either in the public domain or made available under compatible licenses.
