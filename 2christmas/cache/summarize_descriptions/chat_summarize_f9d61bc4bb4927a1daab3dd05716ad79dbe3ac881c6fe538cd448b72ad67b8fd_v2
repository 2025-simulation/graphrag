It provides free access to thousands of eBooks, primarily consisting of works whose copyright has expired, enabling readers worldwide to enjoy literature and scholarly texts without cost or restriction. The project operates under a mission to encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks, emphasizing accessibility, freedom of information, and the democratization of knowledge.\n\nThe legal and administrative responsibilities for Project Gutenberg are managed by the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (PGLAF). PGLAF is the official legal entity that owns and administers the Project Gutenberg collection, including its associated intellectual property rights and license terms. As the steward of the project, PGLAF ensures that the collection adheres to applicable copyright laws and maintains the integrity of the licensing framework under which the eBooks are distributed. This includes overseeing the terms under which users may access, share, and modify the works in accordance with Project Gutenberg’s policies and the public domain status of the materials.\n\nThrough its governance, PGLAF safeguards the legacy and operational continuity of Project Gutenberg, supporting its global mission while handling the legal, financial, and organizational aspects necessary for the project’s sustainability. In essence, while Project Gutenberg serves as the public-facing digital library, PGLAF functions as its institutional backbone, providing the legal structure and administrative oversight required to maintain and expand the collection responsibly.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761477056, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 286, "prompt_tokens": 186, "total_tokens": 472, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
