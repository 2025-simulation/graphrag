In its operations, the Foundation explicitly recognizes U.S. copyright law as the primary legal basis for determining the copyright status of the literary works it archives and distributes. It provides public access to a vast collection of digitized books and other cultural artifacts, primarily focusing on works that are in the public domain under U.S. law. Importantly, the Foundation disclaims any representation or warranty regarding the copyright status of its works outside the UNITED STATES, acknowledging that copyright laws vary significantly by jurisdiction and that its determinations are valid only within the U.S. legal context.
