He plays an active role in the family’s modest but joyful Christmas preparations. On Christmas Day, Master Peter assists in fetching the Christmas goose, a central part of the Cratchits’ festive meal, demonstrating his eagerness to contribute to the household celebration. In addition to helping procure the main dish, he also participates enthusiastically in the cooking process, notably mashing the potatoes with great energy as the family readies their dinner. His involvement in both fetching the goose and preparing the side dishes highlights his helpful nature and the collective spirit of the Cratchit children in making their humble Christmas as special as possible.
