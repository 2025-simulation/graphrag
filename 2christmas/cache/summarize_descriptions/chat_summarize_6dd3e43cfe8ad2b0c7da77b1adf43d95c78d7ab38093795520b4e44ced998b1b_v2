Hart with the mission of digitizing, archiving, and freely distributing cultural and literary works that are in the public domain, particularly in the United States. It operates under the registered trademark “Project Gutenberg” and maintains an official website at www.gutenberg.org, which serves as a central hub for accessing its collection of free electronic books (eBooks), coordinating volunteer efforts, accepting public donations, and providing information about its licensing terms.\n\nThe initiative relies heavily on a global network of volunteers who contribute by transcribing, proofreading, and conducting copyright research to ensure that all distributed works are not protected by U.S. copyright law. Its collection includes thousands of public domain titles, such as the eBook of *A Christmas Carol*, made available in formats designed to be readable across a wide variety of computer systems.\n\nProject Gutenberg distributes its electronic works under a specific license that governs their use and redistribution. This license typically requires proper attribution, adherence to formatting standards, and, in cases where users charge for access to the works, the payment of modest royalty fees to support the project. These terms are intended to preserve the integrity of the works and ensure continued free access while allowing limited commercial use under controlled conditions.\n\nAs a non-profit, community-supported effort, Project Gutenberg sustains its operations through public donations and the dedication of volunteers. Its foundational philosophy emphasizes universal access to knowledge and the preservation of cultural heritage in digital form. By combining rigorous copyright verification with open access principles, Project Gutenberg has become one of the oldest and most respected digital libraries on the internet, playing a pioneering role in the development of the eBook movement.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": null, "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1761476722, "model": "qwen3-max", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": null, "system_fingerprint": null, "usage": {"completion_tokens": 332, "prompt_tokens": 412, "total_tokens": 744, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": null, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
