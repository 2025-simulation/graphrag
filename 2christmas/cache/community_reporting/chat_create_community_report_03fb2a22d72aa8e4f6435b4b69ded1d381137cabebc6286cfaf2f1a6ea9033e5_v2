Despite this, both men jointly signed Jacob Marley’s burial register, indicating a minimal level of shared civic duty. After his transformation, Scrooge expresses deep regret for his treatment of Cratchit, raises his salary, and becomes a 'second father' to Tiny Tim.

This stance reflects a broader 19th-century debate about the role of charity versus state responsibility in addressing social welfare. Scrooge’s eventual rejection of this cold utilitarianism—evidenced by his generous donation to the 'Old Gentleman' and support for the Cratchits—marks a key shift in his moral orientation and serves as a critique of institutional indifference to human suffering.

Known for his harsh demeanor, he treats his clerk Bob Cratchit poorly—paying him a meager fifteen shillings a week and denying him adequate warmth—while dismissing Christmas as “humbug” and rejecting charitable appeals, insisting the poor belong in prisons and workhouses. He lives alone in dusty, echoing chambers, unbothered by darkness or solitude, and is described by the Cratchit family as “the Ogre of the family.” On a foggy Christmas Eve, Scrooge is visited by the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns him of impending supernatural visitations.\n\nOver the course of that night, Scrooge is guided by three Spirits through transformative visions. The Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to scenes from his lonely childhood, his joyful apprenticeship under the generous Fezziwig, and the painful breakup with his fiancée Belle, evoking deep emotion and regret. The Ghost of Christmas Present reveals the humble but loving Cratchit household—highlighting the frailty of Tiny Tim—and shows Christmas celebrations in remote places like lighthouses and ships, as well as at his nephew Fred’s lively party, where Scrooge invisibly participates and experiences rare amusement. The Spirit also exposes Scrooge to the suffering of Ignorance and Want, horrifying him with the consequences of societal neglect.\n\nFinally, the silent Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows Scrooge a vision of a man’s death—later revealed to be his own—marked by indifference and desecration, as well as the Cratchits mourning Tiny Tim’s passing. Terrified and remorseful, Scrooge pleads for redemption. Upon waking on Christmas morning, he undergoes a profound moral transformation. Overjoyed to find he still has time to change, he becomes generous and kind: anonymously sending a large turkey to the Cratchits, raising Bob’s salary, reconciling with Fred, and vowing to honor Christmas in his heart year-round. The reformed Scrooge acts as a second father to Tiny Tim and embraces community with warmth and joy, shedding his former identity as a bitter, self-punishing miser for one of compassion and humanity.\",133\n90,CELLAR,\"The wine-merchant's cellar located deep below Scrooge's room, from which the sound of a dragging chain originates, associated with ghostly activity\",3\n82,LIVERY,\"The Livery refers to the livery companies of the City of London, historic trade associations and guilds that form part of the city's institutional fabric\",2\n97,SCROOGE'S ROOM,\"The interior setting where Scrooge’s encounter with the Ghost takes place, containing a fireplace and chair\",2\n108,MARKET-TOWN,\"A small town from Scrooge’s youth, featuring a bridge, a church, and a winding river; it appears in the distance along the country road and evokes strong nostalgic memories in Scrooge\",2\n110,WINDING RIVER,\"A river that flows through the market-town of Scrooge’s youth, noted for its curving course and association with his childhood memories\",2\n121,YOUNG SCROOGE,,2\n38,THE SECOND OF THE THREE SPIRITS,\"The Second of the Three Spirits refers to the Ghost of Christmas Present, a pivotal supernatural figure in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*.

According to the narrative, the Ghost of Christmas Present is scheduled to appear to Scrooge precisely at one o’clock, following the initial visitation by the Ghost of Christmas Past and preceding the final encounter with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come.  \n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Present embodies the generosity, joy, and communal spirit associated with the Christmas season. Through this spirit’s guidance, Scrooge is shown scenes of contemporary Christmas celebrations, including those of his underpaid clerk Bob Cratchit and his nephew Fred, revealing the warmth and goodwill that Scrooge himself has long rejected. These visions are designed to awaken empathy and understanding in Scrooge, highlighting the immediate human consequences of his miserliness and indifference.  \n\nThe visitation of the Ghost of Christmas Present is a central event in Scrooge’s transformation. It confronts him not only with the festive cheer he has forsaken but also with the harsh realities faced by the less fortunate—most notably the plight of Tiny Tim, Cratchit’s ailing son.

Cloaked in a dark hood that obscures its face, this phantom communicates exclusively through gestures, never uttering a word, which intensifies its eerie and foreboding presence. It evokes profound fear in Scrooge, more so than the other spirits he encounters, due to its shadowy demeanor and the grim nature of the visions it presents. The ghost reveals to Scrooge a series of haunting and ambiguous scenes that depict possible future events, emphasizing the consequences of his current path. These visions include desolate settings in business districts, where conversations among merchants mockingly reference a recent death, and a chilling depiction of an unnamed, unmourned dead man lying in a neglected room—scenes that Scrooge gradually realizes pertain to his own potential fate. Though the future shown is not fixed, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come serves as a dire warning, illustrating the moral and social repercussions of Scrooge’s greed and indifference. Its spectral form and silent communication underscore the inevitability and mystery of death, compelling Scrooge to confront his legacy and prompting his ultimate transformation.

Scrooge employs the clerk under harsh conditions, exercising strict control over even the most basic workplace resources—such as coal for warmth—thereby demonstrating an exploitative and unsympathetic attitude toward his subordinate’s well-being. Despite the clerk’s evident poverty and low income, Scrooge openly criticizes him for celebrating Christmas, viewing the holiday as an unnecessary and foolish indulgence rather than a time for goodwill or compassion. This dynamic highlights Scrooge’s cold pragmatism and disdain for festive generosity, especially when it comes from someone he perceives as financially irresponsible. Their professional relationship is further contextualized by a shared, albeit formal, moment of civic duty: both Scrooge and the clerk signed Marley’s burial register, indicating their joint participation in formalizing the funeral arrangements for Jacob Marley, Scrooge’s deceased business partner. This act suggests that, despite their personal and economic disparities, both men were involved—however perfunctorily—in the official acknowledgment of Marley’s death, a detail that subtly ties their roles together beyond the confines of the workplace.
