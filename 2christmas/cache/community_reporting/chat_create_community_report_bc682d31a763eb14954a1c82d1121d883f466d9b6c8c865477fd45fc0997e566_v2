His establishment is marked by rusty hinges and features a parlour concealed behind a screen of rags. OLD JOE functions not only as a shopkeeper but also as a buyer or fence who appraises and purchases stolen household goods. He is known to chalk prices directly onto the wall and engage in sharp bargaining with those selling to him. Among his customers are Mrs. Dilber and another unnamed woman, both of whom bring him items scavenged from the belongings of a recently deceased man. OLD JOE carefully evaluates these stolen goods, pays the women for their haul, and subsequently profits from reselling them. His role in this transaction underscores his position within a shadowy network of informal trade, where the lines between legitimate commerce and illicit activity blur. Through his interactions and business practices, OLD JOE emerges as a pragmatic, experienced figure accustomed to the margins of society, operating with a blend of shrewdness and detachment in his dealings.\",12\n255,THE UNDERTAKER'S MAN,\"A man in faded black who enters the shop shortly after the two women, also involved in the illicit trade of goods from the dead\",3\n261,THE DECEASED MAN,,3\n260,THE PARLOUR,\"A space behind a screen of rags within Old Joe’s shop, used as a meeting area where the characters converse and examine stolen items\",2\n257,OLD JOE'S SHOP,\"A low-browed, beetling shop in a den of infamous resort where iron, rags, bones, and greasy offal are bought and sold; filled with refuse and secrets\",1\n31,MRS. DILBER,\"Mrs. Dilber is a laundress who appears in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*. Following the death of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge (as depicted in the visions shown to him by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come), Mrs. Dilber is among those who profit from his demise. She arrives at the shop of Old Joe, a dealer in secondhand goods, carrying a bundle of stolen items that once belonged to Scrooge. These include household linens such as sheets and towels, articles of clothing, and personal effects like silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and even boots. At Old Joe’s establishment, she meets with another woman and a man—fellow servants or associates—who have also taken items from Scrooge’s home after his death. Together, the three appraise and sell the stolen goods to Old Joe, openly discussing the circumstances of the miser’s lonely passing with little remorse. Their conversation reveals the callousness with which Scrooge was regarded in life, underscoring the moral lesson of the story: that a life lived without compassion or human connection leads to isolation and an unmourned death. Mrs. Dilber’s role, though minor, serves to illustrate the consequences of Scrooge’s past behavior and reinforces the novella’s themes of redemption, social responsibility, and the importance of kindness. As a laundress, she would have had regular access to Scrooge’s household, placing her in a position to witness firsthand his harshness and neglect—factors that likely contributed to her willingness to participate in the posthumous plundering of his belongings.\",4\n258,THE WOMAN,\"THE WOMAN is an unnamed individual who appears in a scene involving the aftermath of a man’s death. She boldly discusses the demise of what she derisively calls a “wicked old screw,” showing no remorse for his passing. Alongside a character known as Old Joe, she actively participates in taking possessions from the deceased man’s home. Rather than expressing guilt over this act of looting, she justifies it by asserting that the items would otherwise go to waste if left unused or unclaimed by others. Her pragmatic, if morally ambiguous, rationale reflects a belief that repurposing the dead man’s belongings is preferable to letting them sit idle. She is assertive in her dealings, particularly in demanding that Old Joe assess the value of the bundle of goods she has appropriated, underscoring her focus on material gain and transactional fairness.
