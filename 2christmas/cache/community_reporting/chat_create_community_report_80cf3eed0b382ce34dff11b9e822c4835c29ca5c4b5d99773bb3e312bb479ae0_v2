His death was officially recorded, with his burial duly registered, and he named Scrooge as his sole executor, administrator, assign, residuary legatee, friend, and mourner—indicating the depth and exclusivity of their personal and professional relationship. Marley is remembered not only for his close association with Scrooge but also for distinctive physical traits, such as his pigtail, which contribute to his lingering presence in Scrooge’s memory. Even in death, Marley exerts a powerful psychological influence over Scrooge; his face famously haunts Scrooge, appearing as a ghostly visage on the door knocker of Scrooge’s home and dominating Scrooge’s thoughts as he sits alone by the fire. This spectral manifestation underscores the weight of their shared past and the unresolved moral and emotional burdens tied to their partnership.

The enterprise functions as a financial or mercantile establishment—commonly referred to as a counting-house in the context of 19th-century London—where Scrooge manages all operations independently. While some descriptions refer to the firm as “defunct,” this appears to be a mischaracterization; the business is very much active, albeit under Scrooge’s sole proprietorship.

Though Marley has been deceased for seven years, his presence continues to weigh heavily on Scrooge’s conscience and psyche.
