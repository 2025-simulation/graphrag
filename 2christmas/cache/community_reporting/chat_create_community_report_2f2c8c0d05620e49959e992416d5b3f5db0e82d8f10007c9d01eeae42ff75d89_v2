DILBER,\"Mrs. Dilber is a laundress who appears in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*. Following the death of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge (as depicted in the visions shown to him by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come), Mrs. Dilber is among those who profit from his demise. She arrives at the shop of Old Joe, a dealer in secondhand goods, carrying a bundle of stolen items that once belonged to Scrooge. These include household linens such as sheets and towels, articles of clothing, and personal effects like silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and even boots. At Old Joe’s establishment, she meets with another woman and a man—fellow servants or associates—who have also taken items from Scrooge’s home after his death. Together, the three appraise and sell the stolen goods to Old Joe, openly discussing the circumstances of the miser’s lonely passing with little remorse. Their conversation reveals the callousness with which Scrooge was regarded in life, underscoring the moral lesson of the story: that a life lived without compassion or human connection leads to isolation and an unmourned death. Mrs. Dilber’s role, though minor, serves to illustrate the consequences of Scrooge’s past behavior and reinforces the novella’s themes of redemption, social responsibility, and the importance of kindness. As a laundress, she would have had regular access to Scrooge’s household, placing her in a position to witness firsthand his harshness and neglect—factors that likely contributed to her willingness to participate in the posthumous plundering of his belongings.\",4\n258,THE WOMAN,\"THE WOMAN is an unnamed individual who appears in a scene involving the aftermath of a man’s death. She boldly discusses the demise of what she derisively calls a “wicked old screw,” showing no remorse for his passing. Alongside a character known as Old Joe, she actively participates in taking possessions from the deceased man’s home. Rather than expressing guilt over this act of looting, she justifies it by asserting that the items would otherwise go to waste if left unused or unclaimed by others. Her pragmatic, if morally ambiguous, rationale reflects a belief that repurposing the dead man’s belongings is preferable to letting them sit idle. She is assertive in her dealings, particularly in demanding that Old Joe assess the value of the bundle of goods she has appropriated, underscoring her focus on material gain and transactional fairness. Though her identity remains unspecified, her actions and dialogue reveal a shrewd, unapologetic character who operates with a utilitarian sense of morality, prioritizing practicality over conventional ethics in the context of death and inheritance.\",4\n262,THE FIRST WOMAN,\"An unnamed woman who removes and sells bed-curtains (with rings) from the room of a recently deceased man, showing indifference to his death\nAn unnamed woman who brings bed-curtains taken from a deceased man’s room to sell to Old Joe, showing no remorse for her actions)<|COMPLETE|>(\"\"entity\"\"\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n468,OLD JOE,THE DECEASED MAN,\"Old Joe is appraising stolen goods taken from the deceased man, indicating his role in handling the man’s looted possessions\",15\n469,MRS.
