Situated in the city, it serves as his place of business during his lifetime, where he is often depicted working alone. In one poignant scene, another character observes Scrooge through the office window, finding him seated by the dim light of a solitary candle—a visual representation of his isolation and miserly nature. This image underscores his emotional and social detachment, emphasizing the loneliness that characterizes his existence despite his wealth. However, in a vision of the future, the same office space undergoes a telling transformation: it is no longer Scrooge’s domain but has been taken over by another occupant. This shift powerfully signals Scrooge’s absence—whether through death, irrelevance, or abandonment—and reflects the consequences of his life choices. The contrast between the present-day scene of solitary labor and the future’s erasure of his presence within the very space that once defined his professional identity serves as a narrative device highlighting themes of mortality, legacy, and the potential for redemption.
