Dick Wilkins, in particular, is remembered as a cheerful and loyal companion, symbolizing the human connections Scrooge once cherished.

The building’s imposing and somber atmosphere is accentuated by its echoing acoustics and a wide, prominent staircase that connects its multiple levels. The house contains several distinct rooms, including a sitting-room, a bedroom, and a lumber-room filled with stored items. Additionally, it features a cellar and at least one room marked by a dying flame—this specific space serves as the setting for Scrooge’s pivotal encounter with the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley. While Scrooge occupies the dwelling himself, portions of the house are rented out as offices, indicating that the structure functions partially as a commercial property despite its residential character. The blend of private living quarters and rented office spaces underscores the house’s dual role, reflecting Scrooge’s solitary, business-oriented lifestyle. Overall, Scrooge’s House stands as a symbol of isolation and antiquity, its physical layout and ambiance contributing significantly to the eerie and transformative events that unfold within its walls.\",4\n139,OLD GENTLEMAN IN A WELSH WIG,\"A former employer or master to whom Scrooge was apprenticed, seen sitting behind a high desk in a warehouse\",2\n14,EBENEZER SCROOGE,\"Ebenezer Scrooge is the central fictional character in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*, portrayed as a wealthy yet miserly and grasping London businessman and the surviving partner of the firm Scrooge and Marley. Initially depicted as a cynical, skeptical, and emotionally cold man, Scrooge is deeply entrenched in his avaricious ways, showing little regard for the suffering of others or the spirit of Christmas. On Christmas Eve, he is visited by the ghost of his deceased business partner, Jacob Marley, who warns him that his selfish life has condemned his own soul to torment and that Scrooge still has a chance to avoid the same fate. Though initially dismissive and doubtful of the supernatural, Scrooge is deeply unsettled by Marley’s spectral appearance and begins to question whether his experiences are real or merely dreams.\n\nFollowing Marley’s visitation, Scrooge is guided through a transformative journey by three spirits. The Ghost of Christmas Past shows him memories of his youth—such as his time as a joyful apprentice under the kind Fezziwig—and moments of lost love, stirring deep emotion and regret. Next, the Ghost of Christmas Present reveals the current state of the world, including the humble but loving household of his clerk, Bob Cratchit, and the plight of Cratchit’s ailing son, Tiny Tim. During this visit, Scrooge appears more timid and reverent, a marked shift from his formerly dogged demeanor. Finally, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come presents chilling visions of the future, including Scrooge’s own neglected grave and the public indifference to his death. Confronted with the consequences of his actions, Scrooge becomes fearful and remorseful, pleading for a chance to change his fate.\n\nThrough these supernatural encounters, Scrooge undergoes a profound moral and spiritual reclamation. Once a covetous and isolated man, he emerges on Christmas morning as a generous, compassionate, and joyful individual, eager to make amends and embrace the true meaning of Christmas. His transformation—from a figure of greed and skepticism to one of empathy and goodwill—forms the emotional and thematic core of the story, underscoring Dickens’s message about redemption, charity, and the power of human change.\",43\n25,DICK WILKINS,\"Dick Wilkins is a fellow apprentice of Ebenezer Scrooge during Scrooge’s youth, as depicted in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*. He is portrayed as a cheerful and loyal companion who shares a close bond with the young Scrooge. Their relationship is marked by camaraderie and mutual support, with Wilkins being notably attached to Scrooge. Together, they assist with daily tasks in their place of apprenticeship, such as raising the shop shutters, and participate in festive activities. On Christmas Eve, Dick joins Scrooge and their employer, Mr. Fezziwig, in the lively and joyous celebrations that stand in stark contrast to Scrooge’s later miserly demeanor. These shared experiences from Scrooge’s past, revisited during his ghostly visitations, highlight a time when he was capable of warmth, mirth, and human connection—qualities embodied in part by his amiable peer, Dick Wilkins. Though Wilkins appears only briefly in the narrative, his presence serves as a poignant reminder of the joyful, communal spirit that Scrooge once knew but later abandoned.\",3\n284,SCROOGE'S GRAVE,\"A specific grave in the churchyard bearing Ebenezer Scrooge's name, shown to him by the Spirit as part of a vision of his potential future\",2\n294,FRED'S WIFE,\"Fred’s wife, referred to as Scrooge’s “niece by marriage,” who is present at the dinner and startled by Scrooge’s sudden appearance\",2\n22,GHOST OF JACOB MARLEY,The Ghost of Jacob Marley is the spectre of Scrooge's deceased former business partner who warns Scrooge about his fate,1\n32,FAN,Fan is Ebenezer Scrooge's sister,1\n100,WISE MEN,,1\n295,THE OLD GENTLEMAN,\"A philanthropist previously approached by Scrooge for a donation; Scrooge now enthusiastically offers him a generous contribution, signaling his moral redemption\",1\n282,CHURCHYARD,\"A walled, overgrown burial ground where Scrooge sees his own neglected grave, symbolizing the consequences of his current life path\",3\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n104,SCROOGE,SCROOGE'S HOUSE,\"Scrooge is the sole resident of Scrooge's House, which functions as both his personal residence and the primary location for his business activities.
