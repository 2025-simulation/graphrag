It operates under the registered trademark “Project Gutenberg” and maintains an official website at www.gutenberg.org, which serves as a central hub for accessing its collection of free electronic books (eBooks), coordinating volunteer efforts, accepting public donations, and providing information about its licensing terms.\n\nThe initiative relies heavily on a global network of volunteers who contribute by transcribing, proofreading, and conducting copyright research to ensure that all distributed works are not protected by U.S. copyright law. Its collection includes thousands of public domain titles, such as the eBook of *A Christmas Carol*, made available in formats designed to be readable across a wide variety of computer systems.\n\nProject Gutenberg distributes its electronic works under a specific license that governs their use and redistribution. This license typically requires proper attribution, adherence to formatting standards, and, in cases where users charge for access to the works, the payment of modest royalty fees to support the project. These terms are intended to preserve the integrity of the works and ensure continued free access while allowing limited commercial use under controlled conditions.\n\nAs a non-profit, community-supported effort, Project Gutenberg sustains its operations through public donations and the dedication of volunteers. Its foundational philosophy emphasizes universal access to knowledge and the preservation of cultural heritage in digital form.

The United States is explicitly referenced as a primary location where these eBooks may be freely used, and the organization’s trademark and licensing terms are primarily applied under U.S. jurisdiction. Additionally, Project Gutenberg operates in the United States under charity regulations and maintains tax-exempt status, meaning that donations made from within the country are subject to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules. Beyond its practical role in Project Gutenberg’s operations, the United States also appears in a more abstract context—such as in literary or speculative references, including Scrooge’s musings on financial instruments potentially becoming “United States security” if time were disrupted—highlighting its symbolic and institutional weight in discussions of finance, law, and culture.
