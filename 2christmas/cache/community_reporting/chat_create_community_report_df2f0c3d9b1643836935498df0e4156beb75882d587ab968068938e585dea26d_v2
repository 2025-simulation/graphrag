Described as a comely matron, Belle appears during Scrooge’s visit with the Ghost of Christmas Past, where she is shown releasing him from their engagement. She does so with sorrow but clarity, recognizing that Scrooge’s growing obsession with money has supplanted his love for her. This pivotal moment marks the beginning of Scrooge’s emotional isolation and underscores the personal cost of his greed.  \n\nLater in the story, Belle reappears—not as a spectral memory, but as a living woman happily married with children. In this scene, she is depicted sharing a warm, affectionate moment with her husband, who mentions having seen Mr. Scrooge alone and seemingly miserable. Belle recognizes Scrooge as an old friend and joins her husband in a gentle, laughing exchange about him, reflecting both compassion and a sense of peace with her own life choices. Her contentment as a wife and mother stands in stark contrast to Scrooge’s loneliness, emphasizing the life he could have had if he had chosen love over fortune.  \n\nTaken together, these portrayals present Belle as a kind, perceptive, and dignified woman whose departure from Scrooge’s life catalyzes his moral decline—but also offers a redemptive mirror during his transformation. Her presence in both past and present Christmas scenes serves to humanize Scrooge’s history and highlight the emotional void his choices created.
