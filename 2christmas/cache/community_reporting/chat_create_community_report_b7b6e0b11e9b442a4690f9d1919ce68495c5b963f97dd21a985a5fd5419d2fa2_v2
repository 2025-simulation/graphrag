His establishment is characterized by rusty hinges and a back parlour concealed behind a screen of rags, reflecting the grim and impoverished nature of his trade. Old Joe functions not only as a shopkeeper but also as a fence—someone who knowingly buys and appraises stolen goods. He engages in transactions with individuals such as Mrs. Dilber and another unnamed woman, purchasing items they have taken from the belongings of a recently deceased man. In one notable instance, Old Joe is depicted alongside these women as they scavenge through the dead man’s possessions, subsequently counting the money earned from selling these pilfered goods through his shop. This activity underscores his role in a shadowy, morally ambiguous economy that thrives on the misfortune of others. Despite his advanced age and unassuming appearance, Old Joe is a shrewd and pragmatic figure, facilitating the resale of stolen property while maintaining a low-profile presence in the margins of society. His interactions reveal a network of opportunistic individuals who view death not as a moment for mourning, but as a chance for profit. Through his dual role as both a legitimate refuse dealer and an illicit buyer of stolen wares, Old Joe embodies the intersection of poverty, desperation, and moral compromise in his community.\",9\n168,THE UNDERTAKER'S MAN,\"A man in faded black who enters the shop shortly after the two women, also involved in the illicit trade of goods from the dead\",3\n173,THE PARLOUR,\"A space behind a screen of rags within Old Joe’s shop, used as a meeting area where the characters converse and examine stolen items\",2\n170,OLD JOE'S SHOP,\"A low-browed, beetling shop in a den of infamous resort where iron, rags, bones, and greasy offal are bought and sold; filled with refuse and secrets\",1\n166,THE CHARWOMAN,\"A woman who enters Old Joe's shop with a heavy bundle, likely containing stolen goods from a recently deceased person's household\",3\n167,THE LAUNDRESS,\"A woman who follows the charwoman into Old Joe's shop, also carrying a heavy bundle, participating in the resale of stolen items\",3\n171,THE WOMAN,\"THE WOMAN is an unnamed individual who appears in a scene involving the aftermath of a man’s death. She boldly discusses the demise of what she derisively calls a “wicked old screw,” showing no remorse for his passing. Alongside a character known as Old Joe, she actively participates in taking possessions from the deceased man’s home. Rather than expressing guilt over this act of looting, she justifies it by asserting that the items would otherwise go to waste if left unused or unclaimed by others. Her pragmatic, if morally ambiguous, rationale reflects a belief that repurposing the dead man’s belongings is preferable to letting them sit idle. She is assertive in her dealings, particularly in demanding that Old Joe assess the value of the bundle of goods she has appropriated, underscoring her focus on material gain and transactional fairness. Though her identity remains unspecified, her actions and dialogue reveal a shrewd, unapologetic character who operates with a utilitarian sense of morality, prioritizing practicality over conventional ethics in the context of death and inheritance.\",3\n30,MRS. DILBER,\"Mrs. Dilber is a laundress who appears in Charles Dickens’s *A Christmas Carol*. Following the death of the miserly Ebenezer Scrooge (as depicted in the visions shown to him by the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come), Mrs. Dilber is among those who profit from his demise. She arrives at the shop of Old Joe, a dealer in secondhand goods, carrying a bundle of stolen items that once belonged to Scrooge. These include household linens such as sheets and towels, articles of clothing, and personal effects like silver teaspoons, sugar-tongs, and even boots. At Old Joe’s establishment, she meets with another woman and a man—fellow servants or associates—who have also taken items from Scrooge’s home after his death. Together, the three appraise and sell the stolen goods to Old Joe, openly discussing the circumstances of the miser’s lonely passing with little remorse. Their conversation reveals the callousness with which Scrooge was regarded in life, underscoring the moral lesson of the story: that a life lived without compassion or human connection leads to isolation and an unmourned death. Mrs. Dilber’s role, though minor, serves to illustrate the consequences of Scrooge’s past behavior and reinforces the novella’s themes of redemption, social responsibility, and the importance of kindness. As a laundress, she would have had regular access to Scrooge’s household, placing her in a position to witness firsthand his harshness and neglect—factors that likely contributed to her willingness to participate in the posthumous plundering of his belongings.\",2\n172,THE SHOP,\"A decrepit shop with rusty hinges, owned by Old Joe, containing a parlour behind a screen of rags where characters gather at night\",2\n\n\n-----Relationships-----\nhuman_readable_id,source,target,description,combined_degree\n252,SCROOGE,THE DEAD MAN,Scrooge observes the fate of the dead man and fears his own life is heading down the same path of isolation and posthumous dishonor,87\n242,OLD JOE,THE UNDERTAKER'S MAN,\"The undertaker's man also engages in selling goods to Old Joe, completing a trio of opportunistic sellers\",12\n247,OLD JOE,THE PARLOUR,\"Old Joe invites others into the parlour, which is part of his shop\",11\n239,OLD JOE,OLD JOE'S SHOP,\"Old Joe operates and resides in this shop, dealing in scavenged and possibly stolen goods\",10\n243,THE CHARWOMAN,THE LAUNDRESS,Both women coincidentally arrive at Old Joe’s shop to sell stolen goods and recognize each other,6\n245,THE LAUNDRESS,THE UNDERTAKER'S MAN,They arrive together at Old Joe’s shop and are part of the same illicit resale activity,6\n254,THE WOMAN,THE DEAD MAN,\"The woman removed the dead man’s best shirt to prevent it from being 'wasted' in burial, showing callousness toward his remains\",6\n250,MRS.
