The United States is thus a primary location where Project Gutenberg content can be accessed and shared freely by the public.\n\nProject Gutenberg operates within the United States under specific charity regulations and maintains tax-exempt status, which subjects donations made from this region to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules.
