The story centers on Ebenezer Scrooge, a miserly and cold-hearted man, and depicts his profound moral transformation during the Christmas season. Through a series of supernatural visits from the ghost of his former business partner, Jacob Marley, and the spirits of Christmas Past, Present, and Yet to Come, Scrooge confronts his past actions, recognizes the suffering he has caused, and ultimately embraces compassion, generosity, and the spirit of Christmas. The novella serves as a powerful social commentary on poverty, redemption, and the importance of human connection.\n\nSince its initial publication, *A Christmas Carol* has enjoyed enduring popularity and numerous reissues. Notably, a 1915 illustrated edition brought renewed visual interest to the classic tale, enhancing its accessibility and appeal to new generations of readers. In the digital age, the work was digitized and made freely available as a Project Gutenberg eBook in 2007, further cementing its status as a public domain literary treasure and ensuring its continued global reach. The story’s themes of personal redemption and festive goodwill have made it a cornerstone of Christmas literature and a frequently adapted narrative across film, theater, and other media.\",9\n0,PROJECT GUTENBERG,\"Project Gutenberg is a volunteer-driven initiative founded by Michael S.

It operates under the registered trademark “Project Gutenberg” and maintains an official website at www.gutenberg.org, which serves as a central hub for accessing its collection of free electronic books (eBooks), coordinating volunteer efforts, accepting public donations, and providing information about its licensing terms.\n\nThe initiative relies heavily on a global network of volunteers who contribute by transcribing, proofreading, and conducting copyright research to ensure that all distributed works are not protected by U.S. copyright law. Its collection includes thousands of public domain titles, such as the eBook of *A Christmas Carol*, made available in formats designed to be readable across a wide variety of computer systems.\n\nProject Gutenberg distributes its electronic works under a specific license that governs their use and redistribution. This license typically requires proper attribution, adherence to formatting standards, and, in cases where users charge for access to the works, the payment of modest royalty fees to support the project. These terms are intended to preserve the integrity of the works and ensure continued free access while allowing limited commercial use under controlled conditions.\n\nAs a non-profit, community-supported effort, Project Gutenberg sustains its operations through public donations and the dedication of volunteers.
